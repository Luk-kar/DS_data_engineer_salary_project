We are looking for a Full Stack Developer to join our Lisbon officeand solve juicy digital challenges at scale, share expertise with others, and work closely with Reaktor communities in Amsterdam, Helsinki, NYC and Tokyo.

As a Full Stack Developer you…

Have 4+ years of professional web development experience.
Write software from scratch with TypeScript and React.
Take care of both the technical and human side of projects.
Are familiar with automated testing & functional programming.
Enjoy working with juniors and seniors on both the shiny and dirty bits of your repo.
Can create new backend services and tweak CI/CD pipelines when needed.

€40,000 – €65,000 per year

About Reaktor

Working in teams and helping clients is our bread and butter. Reaktor’s cross functional teams consist of Front-end Engineers, Backend / DevOps & SRE specialists, Designers, Data Scientists, and Coaches. We unite our efforts to help future-thinking companies like adidas, Lego, HBO, Finavia, and FC Liverpoolsucceed in their world-scale digital endeavours everyday.

We enjoy working on-site and spending time together, but want to offer you an opportunity for remote work whenever you wish, support your home office set-up and provide a remote-friendly working environment.

Relocation

If you’re not based in Lisbon, no worries. What’s important is that you’d be willing to come join us. To make sure we’re a home for top talent like you, we offer a nice relocation package, as well as all the help and advice you need in moving over.

REQUIREMENTS

We would like to see 4+ years of experience in Full-stack (or experience in all of the above).

Ideally you…

Look forward to taking an active part in shaping your team’s ways of working and programming practices.
View your colleagues and clients as individuals with their respective strengths and weaknesses.
Believe that sometimes tech is best solved with no code at all, but by talking to the right people.

NICE TO HAVE
We believe that there’s no “one size fits all” solution when it comes to tech!

Sometimes the right thing to do is write things from scratch with functional TypeScript utilizing the latest libraries, and sometimes it’s a small humble piece of HTML sprinkled with JavaScript hosted on Netlify. While we have not made hard decisions to use any particular technologies, most of our engagements have React, some form of state management, ramda/ lodash, automated testing / deployment.

Most of the tech challenges are not technical at all

Biggest challenges in tech are paradoxically human related, not tech. Hence we train our people in soft skills (e.g. empathetic listening), organizational skills (e.g. Kanban), and put people first (our work weeks average at 40h/week) and we have a 5-star Glassdoor rating to prove that.
PERKS

We offer everything you’d expect of an international tech company: interesting projects, competitive salary and an opportunity to go on work stays to Reaktor offices around the globe. But what really makes us different is our Nordic culture — expect great attention to the work-life balance with a possibility to work flexible hours; high levels of trust and autonomy; and a friendly team of interesting personalities willing to connect beyond work.

DESCRIPTION

We are looking for a Full Stack Developer to join our Lisbon officeand solve juicy digital challenges at scale, share expertise with others, and work closely with Reaktor communities in Amsterdam, Helsinki, NYC and Tokyo.

As a Full Stack Developer you…

Have 4+ years of professional web development experience.
Write software from scratch with TypeScript and React.
Take care of both the technical and human side of projects.
Are familiar with automated testing & functional programming.
Enjoy working with juniors and seniors on both the shiny and dirty bits of your repo.
Can create new backend services and tweak CI/CD pipelines when needed.

€40,000 – €65,000 per year

About Reaktor

Working in teams and helping clients is our bread and butter. Reaktor’s cross functional teams consist of Front-end Engineers, Backend / DevOps & SRE specialists, Designers, Data Scientists, and Coaches. We unite our efforts to help future-thinking companies like adidas, Lego, HBO, Finavia, and FC Liverpoolsucceed in their world-scale digital endeavours everyday.

We enjoy working on-site and spending time together, but want to offer you an opportunity for remote work whenever you wish, support your home office set-up and provide a remote-friendly working environment.

Relocation

If you’re not based in Lisbon, no worries. What’s important is that you’d be willing to come join us. To make sure we’re a home for top talent like you, we offer a nice relocation package, as well as all the help and advice you need in moving over.

REQUIREMENTS

We would like to see 4+ years of experience in Full-stack (or experience in all of the above).

Ideally you…

Look forward to taking an active part in shaping your team’s ways of working and programming practices.
View your colleagues and clients as individuals with their respective strengths and weaknesses.
Believe that sometimes tech is best solved with no code at all, but by talking to the right people.

NICE TO HAVE
We believe that there’s no “one size fits all” solution when it comes to tech!

Sometimes the right thing to do is write things from scratch with functional TypeScript utilizing the latest libraries, and sometimes it’s a small humble piece of HTML sprinkled with JavaScript hosted on Netlify. While we have not made hard decisions to use any particular technologies, most of our engagements have React, some form of state management, ramda/ lodash, automated testing / deployment.

Most of the tech challenges are not technical at all

Biggest challenges in tech are paradoxically human related, not tech. Hence we train our people in soft skills (e.g. empathetic listening), organizational skills (e.g. Kanban), and put people first (our work weeks average at 40h/week) and we have a 5-star Glassdoor rating to prove that.
PERKS

We offer everything you’d expect of an international tech company: interesting projects, competitive salary and an opportunity to go on work stays to Reaktor offices around the globe. But what really makes us different is our Nordic culture — expect great attention to the work-life balance with a possibility to work flexible hours; high levels of trust and autonomy; and a friendly team of interesting personalities willing to connect beyond work.

We enjoy working on-site and spending time together, but want to offer you an opportunity for remote work whenever you wish, support your home office set-up and provide a remote-friendly working environment.

Relocation

If you’re not based in Lisbon, no worries. What’s important is that you’d be willing to come join us. To make sure we’re a home for top talent like you, we offer a nice relocation package, as well as all the help and advice you need in moving over.

REQUIREMENTS

We would like to see 4+ years of experience in Full-stack (or experience in all of the above).

Ideally you…

Look forward to taking an active part in shaping your team’s ways of working and programming practices.
View your colleagues and clients as individuals with their respective strengths and weaknesses.
Believe that sometimes tech is best solved with no code at all, but by talking to the right people.

NICE TO HAVE
We believe that there’s no “one size fits all” solution when it comes to tech!

Sometimes the right thing to do is write things from scratch with functional TypeScript utilizing the latest libraries, and sometimes it’s a small humble piece of HTML sprinkled with JavaScript hosted on Netlify. While we have not made hard decisions to use any particular technologies, most of our engagements have React, some form of state management, ramda/ lodash, automated testing / deployment.

Most of the tech challenges are not technical at all

Biggest challenges in tech are paradoxically human related, not tech. Hence we train our people in soft skills (e.g. empathetic listening), organizational skills (e.g. Kanban), and put people first (our work weeks average at 40h/week) and we have a 5-star Glassdoor rating to prove that.
PERKS

We offer everything you’d expect of an international tech company: interesting projects, competitive salary and an opportunity to go on work stays to Reaktor offices around the globe. But what really makes us different is our Nordic culture — expect great attention to the work-life balance with a possibility to work flexible hours; high levels of trust and autonomy; and a friendly team of interesting personalities willing to connect beyond work.

DESCRIPTION

We are looking for a Full Stack Developer to join our Lisbon officeand solve juicy digital challenges at scale, share expertise with others, and work closely with Reaktor communities in Amsterdam, Helsinki, NYC and Tokyo.

As a Full Stack Developer you…

Have 4+ years of professional web development experience.
Write software from scratch with TypeScript and React.
Take care of both the technical and human side of projects.
Are familiar with automated testing & functional programming.
Enjoy working with juniors and seniors on both the shiny and dirty bits of your repo.
Can create new backend services and tweak CI/CD pipelines when needed.

€40,000 – €65,000 per year

About Reaktor

Working in teams and helping clients is our bread and butter. Reaktor’s cross functional teams consist of Front-end Engineers, Backend / DevOps & SRE specialists, Designers, Data Scientists, and Coaches. We unite our efforts to help future-thinking companies like adidas, Lego, HBO, Finavia, and FC Liverpoolsucceed in their world-scale digital endeavours everyday.

We enjoy working on-site and spending time together, but want to offer you an opportunity for remote work whenever you wish, support your home office set-up and provide a remote-friendly working environment.

Relocation

If you’re not based in Lisbon, no worries. What’s important is that you’d be willing to come join us. To make sure we’re a home for top talent like you, we offer a nice relocation package, as well as all the help and advice you need in moving over.

REQUIREMENTS

We would like to see 4+ years of experience in Full-stack (or experience in all of the above).

Ideally you…

Look forward to taking an active part in shaping your team’s ways of working and programming practices.
View your colleagues and clients as individuals with their respective strengths and weaknesses.
Believe that sometimes tech is best solved with no code at all, but by talking to the right people.

NICE TO HAVE
We believe that there’s no “one size fits all” solution when it comes to tech!

Sometimes the right thing to do is write things from scratch with functional TypeScript utilizing the latest libraries, and sometimes it’s a small humble piece of HTML sprinkled with JavaScript hosted on Netlify. While we have not made hard decisions to use any particular technologies, most of our engagements have React, some form of state management, ramda/ lodash, automated testing / deployment.

Most of the tech challenges are not technical at all

Biggest challenges in tech are paradoxically human related, not tech. Hence we train our people in soft skills (e.g. empathetic listening), organizational skills (e.g. Kanban), and put people first (our work weeks average at 40h/week) and we have a 5-star Glassdoor rating to prove that.
PERKS

We offer everything you’d expect of an international tech company: interesting projects, competitive salary and an opportunity to go on work stays to Reaktor offices around the globe. But what really makes us different is our Nordic culture — expect great attention to the work-life balance with a possibility to work flexible hours; high levels of trust and autonomy; and a friendly team of interesting personalities willing to connect beyond work.

DESCRIPTION

We are looking for a Full Stack Developer to join our Lisbon officeand solve juicy digital challenges at scale, share expertise with others, and work closely with Reaktor communities in Amsterdam, Helsinki, NYC and Tokyo.

As a Full Stack Developer you…

Have 4+ years of professional web development experience.
Write software from scratch with TypeScript and React.
Take care of both the technical and human side of projects.
Are familiar with automated testing & functional programming.
Enjoy working with juniors and seniors on both the shiny and dirty bits of your repo.
Can create new backend services and tweak CI/CD pipelines when needed.

€40,000 – €65,000 per year

About Reaktor

Working in teams and helping clients is our bread and butter. Reaktor’s cross functional teams consist of Front-end Engineers, Backend / DevOps & SRE specialists, Designers, Data Scientists, and Coaches. We unite our efforts to help future-thinking companies like adidas, Lego, HBO, Finavia, and FC Liverpoolsucceed in their world-scale digital endeavours everyday.

We enjoy working on-site and spending time together, but want to offer you an opportunity for remote work whenever you wish, support your home office set-up and provide a remote-friendly working environment.

Relocation

If you’re not based in Lisbon, no worries. What’s important is that you’d be willing to come join us. To make sure we’re a home for top talent like you, we offer a nice relocation package, as well as all the help and advice you need in moving over.

REQUIREMENTS

We would like to see 4+ years of experience in Full-stack (or experience in all of the above).

Ideally you…

Look forward to taking an active part in shaping your team’s ways of working and programming practices.
View your colleagues and clients as individuals with their respective strengths and weaknesses.
Believe that sometimes tech is best solved with no code at all, but by talking to the right people.

NICE TO HAVE
We believe that there’s no “one size fits all” solution when it comes to tech!

Sometimes the right thing to do is write things from scratch with functional TypeScript utilizing the latest libraries, and sometimes it’s a small humble piece of HTML sprinkled with JavaScript hosted on Netlify. While we have not made hard decisions to use any particular technologies, most of our engagements have React, some form of state management, ramda/ lodash, automated testing / deployment.

Most of the tech challenges are not technical at all

Biggest challenges in tech are paradoxically human related, not tech. Hence we train our people in soft skills (e.g. empathetic listening), organizational skills (e.g. Kanban), and put people first (our work weeks average at 40h/week) and we have a 5-star Glassdoor rating to prove that.
PERKS

We offer everything you’d expect of an international tech company: interesting projects, competitive salary and an opportunity to go on work stays to Reaktor offices around the globe. But what really makes us different is our Nordic culture — expect great attention to the work-life balance with a possibility to work flexible hours; high levels of trust and autonomy; and a friendly team of interesting personalities willing to connect beyond work.

DESCRIPTION

We are looking for a Full Stack Developer to join our Lisbon officeand solve juicy digital challenges at scale, share expertise with others, and work closely with Reaktor communities in Amsterdam, Helsinki, NYC and Tokyo.

As a Full Stack Developer you…

Have 4+ years of professional web development experience.
Write software from scratch with TypeScript and React.
Take care of both the technical and human side of projects.
Are familiar with automated testing & functional programming.
Enjoy working with juniors and seniors on both the shiny and dirty bits of your repo.
Can create new backend services and tweak CI/CD pipelines when needed.

About Reaktor

Working in teams and helping clients is our bread and butter. Reaktor’s cross functional teams consist of Front-end Engineers, Backend / DevOps & SRE specialists, Designers, Data Scientists, and Coaches. We unite our efforts to help future-thinking companies like adidas, Lego, HBO, Finavia, and FC Liverpoolsucceed in their world-scale digital endeavours everyday.

We enjoy working on-site and spending time together, but want to offer you an opportunity for remote work whenever you wish, support your home office set-up and provide a remote-friendly working environment.

Relocation

If you’re not based in Lisbon, no worries. What’s important is that you’d be willing to come join us. To make sure we’re a home for top talent like you, we offer a nice relocation package, as well as all the help and advice you need in moving over.

REQUIREMENTS

We would like to see 4+ years of experience in Full-stack (or experience in all of the above).

Ideally you…

Look forward to taking an active part in shaping your team’s ways of working and programming practices.
View your colleagues and clients as individuals with their respective strengths and weaknesses.
Believe that sometimes tech is best solved with no code at all, but by talking to the right people.

NICE TO HAVE
We believe that there’s no “one size fits all” solution when it comes to tech!

Sometimes the right thing to do is write things from scratch with functional TypeScript utilizing the latest libraries, and sometimes it’s a small humble piece of HTML sprinkled with JavaScript hosted on Netlify. While we have not made hard decisions to use any particular technologies, most of our engagements have React, some form of state management, ramda/ lodash, automated testing / deployment.

Most of the tech challenges are not technical at all

Biggest challenges in tech are paradoxically human related, not tech. Hence we train our people in soft skills (e.g. empathetic listening), organizational skills (e.g. Kanban), and put people first (our work weeks average at 40h/week) and we have a 5-star Glassdoor rating to prove that.
PERKS

We offer everything you’d expect of an international tech company: interesting projects, competitive salary and an opportunity to go on work stays to Reaktor offices around the globe. But what really makes us different is our Nordic culture — expect great attention to the work-life balance with a possibility to work flexible hours; high levels of trust and autonomy; and a friendly team of interesting personalities willing to connect beyond work.

DESCRIPTION

We are looking for a Full Stack Developer to join our Lisbon officeand solve juicy digital challenges at scale, share expertise with others, and work closely with Reaktor communities in Amsterdam, Helsinki, NYC and Tokyo.

As a Full Stack Developer you…

Have 4+ years of professional web development experience.
Write software from scratch with TypeScript and React.
Take care of both the technical and human side of projects.
Are familiar with automated testing & functional programming.
Enjoy working with juniors and seniors on both the shiny and dirty bits of your repo.
Can create new backend services and tweak CI/CD pipelines when needed.

€40,000 – €65,000 per year

About Reaktor

Working in teams and helping clients is our bread and butter. Reaktor’s cross functional teams consist of Front-end Engineers, Backend / DevOps & SRE specialists, Designers, Data Scientists, and Coaches. We unite our efforts to help future-thinking companies like adidas, Lego, HBO, Finavia, and FC Liverpoolsucceed in their world-scale digital endeavours everyday.

We enjoy working on-site and spending time together, but want to offer you an opportunity for remote work whenever you wish, support your home office set-up and provide a remote-friendly working environment.

Relocation

If you’re not based in Lisbon, no worries. What’s important is that you’d be willing to come join us. To make sure we’re a home for top talent like you, we offer a nice relocation package, as well as all the help and advice you need in moving over.

REQUIREMENTS

We would like to see 4+ years of experience in Full-stack (or experience in all of the above).

Ideally you…

Look forward to taking an active part in shaping your team’s ways of working and programming practices.
View your colleagues and clients as individuals with their respective strengths and weaknesses.
Believe that sometimes tech is best solved with no code at all, but by talking to the right people.

NICE TO HAVE
We believe that there’s no “one size fits all” solution when it comes to tech!

Sometimes the right thing to do is write things from scratch with functional TypeScript utilizing the latest libraries, and sometimes it’s a small humble piece of HTML sprinkled with JavaScript hosted on Netlify. While we have not made hard decisions to use any particular technologies, most of our engagements have React, some form of state management, ramda/ lodash, automated testing / deployment.

Most of the tech challenges are not technical at all

Biggest challenges in tech are paradoxically human related, not tech. Hence we train our people in soft skills (e.g. empathetic listening), organizational skills (e.g. Kanban), and put people first (our work weeks average at 40h/week) and we have a 5-star Glassdoor rating to prove that.
PERKS

We offer everything you’d expect of an international tech company: interesting projects, competitive salary and an opportunity to go on work stays to Reaktor offices around the globe. But what really makes us different is our Nordic culture — expect great attention to the work-life balance with a possibility to work flexible hours; high levels of trust and autonomy; and a friendly team of interesting personalities willing to connect beyond work.

Our mission is to grow global online commerce for the world's small businesses by removing the barriers to online trading.
Currently, due to antiquated and high-cost payment networks, over $19tn of trade payments are made offline, adding complexity and inconvenience to online trading. This has resulted in local retailers, who directly influence >80% of local consumer buying behaviour, often being the least technically equipped with data, pricing, or the latest inventory.
So we built an Open Commerce Platform that enables the sale and distribution of FMCG products to be made much simpler. Products should be in front of sellers fast, in real-time, through an immersive commerce experience, with trade buyers and sellers able to see live commerce opportunities and pricing.
