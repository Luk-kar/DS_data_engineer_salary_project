Our vision is for the UK to be a world leader in technology for education and research and our mission is to power and empower our members with the technology and data they need to succeed. We know that digital technology has the ability to transform the student experience. We have the experience, expertise and know-how to drive that transformation.

At Jisc, everyone plays a key role and gets the chance to feel part of it, that to us is the definition of a meaningful career. We want to create a culture of lifelong learning.

About the role:
The technology and data team sits within our digital resources (DR) directorate. We provides high quality management and support across the directorate’s products and services. It provides the technical infrastructure to support all we do, bringing expertise of the domain-specific data within our sectors and utilising new technologies and professional standards.

You will create and maintain organisational knowledge about data and the systems through which it moves, to enable the organisation to manage its data as an asset and increase the value it gets from data by identifying opportunities for data usage, cost reduction and risk mitigation.

This role represents a great opportunity to learn about data architecture with a career path into this discipline. We are looking for a background in data engineering or business intelligence/data warehousing. This is a great opportunity for someone looking to move from the development and maintenance of data architecture, to a design and strategy-focused role.

We know that sometimes people can be put off applying for a job if they think they can’t tick every box but we realise the ‘perfect candidate’ doesn’t exist. So, if you can do most of what we’re looking for, go ahead and apply. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles!

Why work at Jisc:
At Jisc we believe a balance between your personal and professional life is essential to your happiness and fulfilment. We work flexibly at Jisc and focus on outputs rather than presenteeism and are open to a whole range of ways of working. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life.

We offer hybrid working and although the majority of our staff work from home, getting face to face is something we value and find time for when we can. If you prefer an office environment all our hubs are open and offer a great space to work.

Our benefits are great too. We offer:
