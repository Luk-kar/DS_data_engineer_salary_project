It culminates in careful attention to edge cases and error handling, polished code, and great tests to ensure that we ship reliable code that never compromises data integrity or security. Every Dropbox software release improves millions of lives, and you'll find a high petabyte-to-engineer ratio here. We're bold when it comes to shipping high-leverage projects, even if they're risky or novel.
We care deeply about collaboration, feedback, and iteration. Trust and respect are deeply rooted in our engineering culture. At the heart of Dropbox lies the largest networked filesystem in history.

BAE Systems Digital Intelligence is home to 4,800 digital, cyber and intelligence experts. We work collaboratively across 16 countries to collect, connect and understand complex data, so that governments, nation states, armed forces and commercial businesses can unlock digital advantage in the most demanding environments.

Role Description

The Data Engineer implements, test and configures code based on traditional RDBMS and Big Data approaches to deliver data driven projects and solutions. The Data Engineer analyses requirements and design and understands how data is used, manipulated and processed, and combines these skills to create innovative solutions to business problems.



You will join Database team focused on software delivery of an advanced telecoms data processing solution. Team is responsible for development of new database features and support of existing solutions. Team collaborates with Software Engineers, Quality Assurance Engineers, System Consultants and Service Delivery Managers across the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific and the Middle East.

By embracing technology, we can interact, collaborate and create together, even when we're working remotely from one another. Hybrid Working allows for increased flexibility in when and where we work, helping us to balance our work and personal life more effectively, and enhance well-being.

BAE Systems Digital Intelligence is home to 4,800 digital, cyber and intelligence experts. We work collaboratively across 16 countries to collect, connect and understand complex data, so that governments, nation states, armed forces and commercial businesses can unlock digital advantage in the most demanding environments.

Role Description

The Data Engineer implements, test and configures code based on traditional RDBMS and Big Data approaches to deliver data driven projects and solutions. The Data Engineer analyses requirements and design and understands how data is used, manipulated and processed, and combines these skills to create innovative solutions to business problems.



You will join Database team focused on software delivery of an advanced telecoms data processing solution. Team is responsible for development of new database features and support of existing solutions. Team collaborates with Software Engineers, Quality Assurance Engineers, System Consultants and Service Delivery Managers across the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific and the Middle East.





We are embracing Hybrid Working. This means you and your colleagues may be working in different locations, such as from home, another BAE Systems office or client site, some or all of the time, and work might be going on at different times of the day.

By embracing technology, we can interact, collaborate and create together, even when we're working remotely from one another. Hybrid Working allows for increased flexibility in when and where we work, helping us to balance our work and personal life more effectively, and enhance well-being.

Diversity and inclusion are integral to the success of BAE Systems Digital Intelligence.
