The department: Global Tribe Cloud
The purpose of the Global Tribe Cloud is to build and run the target infrastructure platform in a (private) cloud delivery model. This delivery model is based on multi-tenant, self-service, pay-per-use capabilities for application DevOps teams as defined in our One Way of Working. We deliver services for ING engineers worldwide, and onboarding new countries to our private cloud happens all the time.
Tribe Cloud comprises five Global Areas:
The ELKaaS service that we offer is part of the Area Data Services. While the Area Data Services consists of colleagues working in the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Germany and India, the 5 engineers currently working on ELKaaS all work in Germany. As ING appreciates the idea of working from home, there is absolutely no requirement to be based in Germany to fulfil this position. However, it would make sense to physically meet up with the team in Germany once in a couple months. And of course, you will also be invited to our yearly internal cloud conference in Amsterdam.


Your toolbox is the towards INGs DevOps teams worldwide: you develop and support global, containerised solutions for log file monitoring and metrics analysis, record and recognize dependencies to other systems and processes, and your team can count on your IT knowledge and process understanding. Our containerized ELKaaS offering runs on OpenShift 4 and all changes are done via our Azure DevOps pipeline. The ELKaaS service is gaining popularity and it is more and more being integrated into core systems of ING, meaning that soon standby shifts (occasionally) will be part of the job.

The department: Global Tribe Cloud
The purpose of the Global Tribe Cloud is to build and run the target infrastructure platform in a (private) cloud delivery model. This delivery model is based on multi-tenant, self-service, pay-per-use capabilities for application DevOps teams as defined in our One Way of Working. We deliver services for ING engineers worldwide, and onboarding new countries to our private cloud happens all the time.
Tribe Cloud comprises five Global Areas:
The ELKaaS service that we offer is part of the Area Data Services. While the Area Data Services consists of colleagues working in the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Germany and India, the 5 engineers currently working on ELKaaS all work in Germany. As ING appreciates the idea of working from home, there is absolutely no requirement to be based in Germany to fulfil this position. However, it would make sense to physically meet up with the team in Germany once in a couple months. And of course, you will also be invited to our yearly internal cloud conference in Amsterdam.


Your toolbox is the towards INGs DevOps teams worldwide: you develop and support global, containerised solutions for log file monitoring and metrics analysis, record and recognize dependencies to other systems and processes, and your team can count on your IT knowledge and process understanding. Our containerized ELKaaS offering runs on OpenShift 4 and all changes are done via our Azure DevOps pipeline. The ELKaaS service is gaining popularity and it is more and more being integrated into core systems of ING, meaning that soon standby shifts (occasionally) will be part of the job.

The department: Global Tribe Cloud
The purpose of the Global Tribe Cloud is to build and run the target infrastructure platform in a (private) cloud delivery model. This delivery model is based on multi-tenant, self-service, pay-per-use capabilities for application DevOps teams as defined in our One Way of Working. We deliver services for ING engineers worldwide, and onboarding new countries to our private cloud happens all the time.
Tribe Cloud comprises five Global Areas:
The ELKaaS service that we offer is part of the Area Data Services. While the Area Data Services consists of colleagues working in the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Germany and India, the 5 engineers currently working on ELKaaS all work in Germany. As ING appreciates the idea of working from home, there is absolutely no requirement to be based in Germany to fulfil this position. However, it would make sense to physically meet up with the team in Germany once in a couple months. And of course, you will also be invited to our yearly internal cloud conference in Amsterdam.


Your toolbox is the towards INGs DevOps teams worldwide: you develop and support global, containerised solutions for log file monitoring and metrics analysis, record and recognize dependencies to other systems and processes, and your team can count on your IT knowledge and process understanding. Our containerized ELKaaS offering runs on OpenShift 4 and all changes are done via our Azure DevOps pipeline. The ELKaaS service is gaining popularity and it is more and more being integrated into core systems of ING, meaning that soon standby shifts (occasionally) will be part of the job.

The purpose of the Global Tribe Cloud is to build and run the target infrastructure platform in a (private) cloud delivery model. This delivery model is based on multi-tenant, self-service, pay-per-use capabilities for application DevOps teams as defined in our One Way of Working. We deliver services for ING engineers worldwide, and onboarding new countries to our private cloud happens all the time.
Tribe Cloud comprises five Global Areas:

While the Area Data Services consists of colleagues working in the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Germany and India, the 5 engineers currently working on ELKaaS all work in Germany. As ING appreciates the idea of working from home, there is absolutely no requirement to be based in Germany to fulfil this position. However, it would make sense to physically meet up with the team in Germany once in a couple months. And of course, you will also be invited to our yearly internal cloud conference in Amsterdam.


Your toolbox is the towards INGs DevOps teams worldwide: you develop and support global, containerised solutions for log file monitoring and metrics analysis, record and recognize dependencies to other systems and processes, and your team can count on your IT knowledge and process understanding. Our containerized ELKaaS offering runs on OpenShift 4 and all changes are done via our Azure DevOps pipeline. The ELKaaS service is gaining popularity and it is more and more being integrated into core systems of ING, meaning that soon standby shifts (occasionally) will be part of the job.

The department: Global Tribe Cloud
The purpose of the Global Tribe Cloud is to build and run the target infrastructure platform in a (private) cloud delivery model. This delivery model is based on multi-tenant, self-service, pay-per-use capabilities for application DevOps teams as defined in our One Way of Working. We deliver services for ING engineers worldwide, and onboarding new countries to our private cloud happens all the time.
Tribe Cloud comprises five Global Areas:
The ELKaaS service that we offer is part of the Area Data Services. While the Area Data Services consists of colleagues working in the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Germany and India, the 5 engineers currently working on ELKaaS all work in Germany. As ING appreciates the idea of working from home, there is absolutely no requirement to be based in Germany to fulfil this position. However, it would make sense to physically meet up with the team in Germany once in a couple months. And of course, you will also be invited to our yearly internal cloud conference in Amsterdam.


Your toolbox is the towards INGs DevOps teams worldwide: you develop and support global, containerised solutions for log file monitoring and metrics analysis, record and recognize dependencies to other systems and processes, and your team can count on your IT knowledge and process understanding. Our containerized ELKaaS offering runs on OpenShift 4 and all changes are done via our Azure DevOps pipeline. The ELKaaS service is gaining popularity and it is more and more being integrated into core systems of ING, meaning that soon standby shifts (occasionally) will be part of the job.

The department: Global Tribe Cloud
The purpose of the Global Tribe Cloud is to build and run the target infrastructure platform in a (private) cloud delivery model. This delivery model is based on multi-tenant, self-service, pay-per-use capabilities for application DevOps teams as defined in our One Way of Working. We deliver services for ING engineers worldwide, and onboarding new countries to our private cloud happens all the time.
Tribe Cloud comprises five Global Areas:
The ELKaaS service that we offer is part of the Area Data Services. While the Area Data Services consists of colleagues working in the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Germany and India, the 5 engineers currently working on ELKaaS all work in Germany. As ING appreciates the idea of working from home, there is absolutely no requirement to be based in Germany to fulfil this position. However, it would make sense to physically meet up with the team in Germany once in a couple months. And of course, you will also be invited to our yearly internal cloud conference in Amsterdam.


Your toolbox is the towards INGs DevOps teams worldwide: you develop and support global, containerised solutions for log file monitoring and metrics analysis, record and recognize dependencies to other systems and processes, and your team can count on your IT knowledge and process understanding. Our containerized ELKaaS offering runs on OpenShift 4 and all changes are done via our Azure DevOps pipeline. The ELKaaS service is gaining popularity and it is more and more being integrated into core systems of ING, meaning that soon standby shifts (occasionally) will be part of the job.
