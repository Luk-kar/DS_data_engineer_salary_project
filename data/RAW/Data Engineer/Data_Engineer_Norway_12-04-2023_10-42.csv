About this role

DHIS2 software engineers develop a platform used to improve health care at a global scale. We work directly with end-users in order to understand how our system is being used. DHIS2 developers work in small teams and have significant impact on the product. We are seeking software engineers who are passionate about developing elegant, high-performance web applications.

At HISP you will be part of the software design process and have great influence on the end product. We give you the vision and the challenge — you have the freedom to choose your own approach to problem solving. And of course, you can pick your hardware, tools and IDE. Our front-end is built with modern frameworks including React and Redux, and we maintain a powerful developer toolchain (called the application platform) which is used both internally and externally by DHIS2 application developers.

DHIS2 has been built API-first with an extensible app architecture. We continuously deliver our applications and have short, iterative development cycles. You can find our source code on GitHub. Check out the backend repository and a typical front-end app repository. We also support a developer community building on top of the DHIS2 platform.

What You'll Do

At HISP you will specialize in building software features for the DHIS2 open-source platform. You will work on features related to analytics, information retrieval, metadata management, offline data collection and data synchronization. The role requires a passion and ability for finding innovative engineering solutions to complex problems.

Qualification requirements

Fluent in verbal and written English
Strong skills in clear technical writing and communication
Expert knowledge of Javascript
Expert knowledge of web technologies (HTML/CSS).
Strong experience with and deep understanding of React or similar frameworks
Strong experience working with REST Web APIs and JSON


Knowledge of DHIS2 software is an advantage
Experience building technology for use in low-resource settings is a plus
Experience in public health and international development is a plus, but not required
Personal skills
Passionate about working on a meaningful, impactful, and challenging global project
Committed, independent, reliable and structured person who, in collaboration with other colleagues, focuses on contributing to good solutions

Sopra Steria,3.8,Norway,Data Management-konsulent,"Om stillingen
Sopra Steria har endelig etablert seg nordpå også, nærmere bestemt i Tromsø. Ett år siden oppstart, og vi har allerede fått en god posisjon. Vi har det siste året etablert oss i Bergen, Fredrikstad, Drammen, Kristiansand og Hamar også. Vi ønsker de beste i byen til å være med på å bygge oss opp til å bli den foretrukne leverandøren av IT-tjenester og transformasjon hos kundene i Nord-Norge. Vi har et sterkt selskap i ryggen, tilgang på et ekstremt bredt spekter av kompetanse og vi kan vise til lignende suksesshistorier både i Trondheim og Stavanger, hvor vi i sistnevnte lokasjon har gått fra 0 til 200 ansatte på kun fem år!

Nå trenger vi nye kolleger som kan være med å bygge videre vårt miljø rundt Data Management i Tromsø. Har du erfaring med databaser, datavarehus, datalakes og/eller analyseverktøy - on-prem eller i sky - og ønsker å videreutvikle deg til å bli en ekspert som kan hjelpe våre kunder med å bli mer data- og analysedrevet – da er vi rett sted for deg. Hos oss vil du jobbe med svært dyktige og engasjerte kolleger i et faglig spennende og sosialt miljø. Du vil være del av et voksende fagmiljø som stadig styrker vår posisjon som eksperter på data- og analyseplattformer, datavarehus, dataflyter, transformasjon/modellering og rapportering/visualisering m.m. Vi har evner til å designe, bygge og forvalte løsninger for de mest spennende kundene i Norge, og vi utvikler og skaper innsikt innenfor både privat og offentlig sektor.


Du trigges av å skape gode kundeopplevelser, du er opptatt av å lære nye ting, og både bruke og videreformidle kunnskapen du allerede sitter på. Du er komfortabel med en hektisk arbeidshverdag og jobber godt i team, så vel som alene. Kanskje har du også en ambisjon om å bli en spydspiss innen etablering av høyt automatiserte dataplattformer som tilgjengeliggjør maskinlæring, kunstig intelligens eller analyse for alle, i en kontekst de kjenner, på et nivå de mestrer. Det som er sikkert, er at du har innsikt i hvordan dataanalyse kan skape verdi på tvers av forretningsområder. Du er metodisk, har gode analytiske ferdigheter, og du er nysgjerrig på moderne dataplattformer og fremtidsrettet teknologi.


Sopra Steria har hatt en formidabel organisk vekst på stadig flere lokasjoner i Norge, og har nå fått godt fotfeste også i Nord-Norge. Vi har det siste året etablert kontor og fått med oss veldig dyktige folk på laget. Vi har allerede blitt en god gjeng på kontoret vårt i Tromsø, hvorav 10+ tilhører fagområdene rundt Cloud, og du vil bli en del av en faglig dyktig miljø av tekniske konsulenter, samt at vi i tillegg har Norges ledende miljø innenfor Cloud nasjonalt.


Den viktigste årsaken til at du bør vurdere å søke, er muligheten til å bryne deg på og lære av et stort, morsomt og dyktig fagmiljø. Du vil også få muligheten til å jobbe for bransjens mest spennende kunder, og jobbe med et bredt spekter av prosjekter med stor samfunnsmessig betydning. Vi har naturligvis gode forsikrings- og pensjonsordninger med privat helseforsikring og du får full lønn under foreldrepermisjon. I tillegg vil du få tilgang på bedriftshytter, bidrag til medlemskap hos SATS og ikke minst en ekstra ferieuke (seks uker totalt). Dessuten har vi mange ulike aktivitetsgrupper; fotball, friluftsliv, gaming og karaoke, for å nevne noen. Men frykt ikke, deltagelse er høyst frivillig. Vi bør kanskje også nevne at vi er kåret til Norges beste arbeidsplass seks år på rad!

About this role

DHIS2 software engineers develop a platform used to improve health care at a global scale. We work directly with end-users in order to understand how our system is being used.

DHIS2 has been built API-first with an extensible app architecture. We continuously deliver our applications and have short, iterative development cycles. You can find our source code on GitHub. Check out the backend repository and a typical front-end app repository. We also support a developer community building on top of the DHIS2 platform.

What You'll Do

At HISP you will specialize in building software features for the DHIS2 open-source platform.
