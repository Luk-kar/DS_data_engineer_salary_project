Avaap,4.2,"Columbus, OH",Data & Analytics - Data Engineer,"Data & Analytics – Data Engineer

Avaap is looking for a Data Engineer; someone that has a deep appreciation for all things data and has the experience and skills to use data to drive tangible value. You may come from a traditional business intelligence background, or your experience may be fully immersed in the modern analytics landscape; either way, you hold a vast level of experience with key data engineering principles, techniques, tools and methodologies.

Technical Solutioning – you have the depth and skill to fully own key components/workstreams related to the conceptual development of complex technical solutions from design through deployment and operations. As a Data Engineer, you are versed in fully understanding the big picture when it comes to data engineering/data solutioning and have a keen eye for details to design, develop and deploy every component that you have been assigned. While you have strong articulation skills to describe a technical solution and can help communicate its key features and capabilities to others with ease, you prioritize your contributions by example by rolling up your sleeves and doing hands on development using a variety technologies, tools, and techniques.

Project Delivery – you have the experience to understand and appreciate that no matter how cool a technical data solution is, it is worthless if it never gets built and delivered correctly. As a Data Engineer, you are focused on developing strong work plans that align to the overall delivery approach for your team to design, develop and deploy a technical data solution. You understand the value of a work break down structure and have 10+ years of experience in developing project delivery plans related to the design and development of key pieces to large and complex data solutions. You see the value of project management techniques in whatever combination of waterfall, agile and/or a hybrid approach and can develop and execute upon project delivery plans. Your communication skills and experiences as a delivery leader are critical and you make sure to keep everyone from individual contributors on your team to your project leaders, and clients in the loop about progress, with an emphasis on communicating across organizations and levels. If critical issues block progress, refer them up the chain of command to be resolved in a timely manner.

People Management – let us be real, not even the smartest and most talented Data Engineer can do it by her/himself; everyone needs a team and Avaap prides itself on a team first culture. You have 10+ years of experience leading teams of consultants (and sometimes client resources) through complex and transformative delivery efforts on the workstreams you will manage. Your experience as a Data Engineer is to be a leader for your workstream and you bring the requisite people skills that establish a healthy and respectful culture on your projects and for your teammates. As a Data Engineer, you embrace being positioned as a mentor for many junior resources that may be on your projects. You positively influence less experienced, junior resources to support not only their project contributions, but also support their professional development/career roles by providing them key insights from your own working experiences.

As a Data Engineer, you are versed in fully understanding the big picture when it comes to data engineering/data solutioning and have a keen eye for details to design, develop and deploy every component that you have been assigned. While you have strong articulation skills to describe a technical solution and can help communicate its key features and capabilities to others with ease, you prioritize your contributions by example by rolling up your sleeves and doing hands on development using a variety technologies, tools, and techniques.

Project Delivery – you have the experience to understand and appreciate that no matter how cool a technical data solution is, it is worthless if it never gets built and delivered correctly. As a Data Engineer, you are focused on developing strong work plans that align to the overall delivery approach for your team to design, develop and deploy a technical data solution. You understand the value of a work break down structure and have 10+ years of experience in developing project delivery plans related to the design and development of key pieces to large and complex data solutions. You see the value of project management techniques in whatever combination of waterfall, agile and/or a hybrid approach and can develop and execute upon project delivery plans. Your communication skills and experiences as a delivery leader are critical and you make sure to keep everyone from individual contributors on your team to your project leaders, and clients in the loop about progress, with an emphasis on communicating across organizations and levels. If critical issues block progress, refer them up the chain of command to be resolved in a timely manner.

People Management – let us be real, not even the smartest and most talented Data Engineer can do it by her/himself; everyone needs a team and Avaap prides itself on a team first culture. You have 10+ years of experience leading teams of consultants (and sometimes client resources) through complex and transformative delivery efforts on the workstreams you will manage. Your experience as a Data Engineer is to be a leader for your workstream and you bring the requisite people skills that establish a healthy and respectful culture on your projects and for your teammates. As a Data Engineer, you embrace being positioned as a mentor for many junior resources that may be on your projects. You positively influence less experienced, junior resources to support not only their project contributions, but also support their professional development/career roles by providing them key insights from your own working experiences.

Avaap is looking for a Data Engineer; someone that has a deep appreciation for all things data and has the experience and skills to use data to drive tangible value. You may come from a traditional business intelligence background, or your experience may be fully immersed in the modern analytics landscape; either way, you hold a vast level of experience with key data engineering principles, techniques, tools and methodologies.

Technical Solutioning – you have the depth and skill to fully own key components/workstreams related to the conceptual development of complex technical solutions from design through deployment and operations. As a Data Engineer, you are versed in fully understanding the big picture when it comes to data engineering/data solutioning and have a keen eye for details to design, develop and deploy every component that you have been assigned. While you have strong articulation skills to describe a technical solution and can help communicate its key features and capabilities to others with ease, you prioritize your contributions by example by rolling up your sleeves and doing hands on development using a variety technologies, tools, and techniques.

Project Delivery – you have the experience to understand and appreciate that no matter how cool a technical data solution is, it is worthless if it never gets built and delivered correctly. As a Data Engineer, you are focused on developing strong work plans that align to the overall delivery approach for your team to design, develop and deploy a technical data solution. You understand the value of a work break down structure and have 10+ years of experience in developing project delivery plans related to the design and development of key pieces to large and complex data solutions.

If critical issues block progress, refer them up the chain of command to be resolved in a timely manner.

People Management – let us be real, not even the smartest and most talented Data Engineer can do it by her/himself; everyone needs a team and Avaap prides itself on a team first culture. You have 10+ years of experience leading teams of consultants (and sometimes client resources) through complex and transformative delivery efforts on the workstreams you will manage. Your experience as a Data Engineer is to be a leader for your workstream and you bring the requisite people skills that establish a healthy and respectful culture on your projects and for your teammates.
