Some weeks are staggered, which means your working days may be either Sunday-Thursday, Monday-Friday, or Tuesday-Saturday. Engineers usually rotate between shift times and staggered weeks. Support Engineers have transparent work schedules, and do not need to join on-call rotations, or on-site customer meetings. You can discuss suitable workplace options (in-office, remote, or a combination) with your supervisor based on your development stage and needs.

We value diversity and each person’s unique experience. Curiosity and passion for learning let us build and grow in an industry where our services, technology and customer requirements are constantly evolving. Thinking big, tenacity, and perseverance help us conquer challenges and work through ambiguity.

Support Engineering Role and Responsibilities
As a Cloud Support Engineer at AWS, the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, you will have the opportunity to deepen and broaden your technical expertise, engage with a wide range of customers from the smallest startups to the largest enterprises, and enjoy work-life balance.
身為 AWS 的雲端工程師，你有機會深化和拓展你的技術專長，和廣泛的客戶族群 — 小型新創公司到大型企業用戶 — 接觸，並享受工作與生活的平衡。

You will use your engineering expertise and skills to provide high quality technical solutions that help customers achieve their business goals. You dive deep into complex questions to find the root cause and ensure the customer’s specific requirements are fulfilled. Customers consult you about their plans and problems through various contact channels including telephone, email, and web/live chat. You listen carefully to fully understand each customer’s concerns and requirements. You guide customers by sharing facts that are backed by your troubleshooting findings and log data.
你需要運用專業知識提供客戶高品質的技術解決方案，幫助實現客戶的工作目標。你將深入探討複雜案件並找出根本原因以滿足客戶特定需求。客戶會透過電話、電子郵件和即時聊天軟體向你諮詢他們的計劃和問題。你必須充分了解每個客戶的需求及考量，並告知故障排除的結果以及提供數據資料來協助客戶解決問題。

All Cloud Engineers need to understand networking concepts such as network layers (the OSI model), IP connectivity, TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, and how to troubleshoot common connection issues. AWS new hire training includes these topics, so you will study these more during onboarding. Cloud Engineers at AWS Taipei need excellent communication skills in Mandarin, and intermediate English proficiency. Cloud Engineers will interact with customers and read training material in both Mandarin and English.
所有的雲端工程師都需具備基本的網路概念，例如網路層（OSI 模型）、IP 連接、TCP、UDP、DNS、HTTP，以及如何解決常見的網路連線問題。 AWS 的培訓課程將包括這些主題，所以你將在訓練時期學到更多。 此外，雲端工程師將與國內外客戶互動並閱讀中文/英文的培訓教材，所以你需具備出色的中文溝通能力和中等英語能力。

You’ll frequently co-work with Technical Account Managers, Solution Architects, and Business Development Managers to ensure solution alignment and excellent customer experience. You engage with subject matter expects and AWS service development teams across the world when needed. Every day will bring exciting challenges and include learning new skills. Mentorship and coaching are very important at AWS - Experienced Amazonians are on-hand to mentor you throughout your career at AWS. Support Engineers have the opportunity and resources to become certified subject matter experts. As you grow at AWS, there are various opportunities, including joining AWS teams abroad.
你會與 Technical Account Managers, Solution Architects 及 Business Development Managers 協助客戶解決問題並提供良好的顧客體驗；你也有機會和世界各地頂尖 Subject Matter Expects (SME) 和 AWS service development teams 一起完成目標。每天迎接新的挑戰並學習新的技術，不僅了解 AWS 的雲端服務如何運用在不同產業及規模的客戶端，更能接觸多樣化的使用情境。Mentorship 在 AWS 也十分重要，加入之後會有經驗豐富的亞馬遜人隨時提供指導。將來更有機會成為 subject matter experts (SME)。 不僅如此，隨著你在 AWS 的成長，我們提供多樣的職涯發展選擇，也包含海外 AWS 工作機會。

Although the majority of Taipei site’s customers prefer to communicate in Mandarin, some customers do require support in English. AWS Support Engineers frequently interact with international colleagues and study technical documentation in English. If you have a 3rd language skill, do let us know! Instructor led training may include classes in both Mandarin or English. Apart from working on a broad spectrum of technical issues, Support Engineers may also develop & host training, create technical articles, star in how-to videos, present at AWS events, participate in new hiring, write tools/scripts, or work with leadership on process improvement and strategic initiatives. At AWS, your contributions can bring significant positive impact to colleagues and customers globally.
在台灣絕大多數的客戶使用中文溝通，但我們還是需要用英文協助部分客戶。雲端工程師會經常與全球頂尖工程師們研究或討論英文技術文件，當然，如果你還會第三外語，歡迎讓我們知道！培訓的課程會涵蓋中文及英文。除了處理不同深度、廣度的技術問題外，雲端工程師可以制定或指導訓練課程、撰寫技術文章、在操作影片中擔任講者、出席 AWS 活動、參與招募流程、撰寫工具/腳本或更上一層進行流程改善及策略發想。在 AWS，你的貢獻可以為全球同事和客戶帶來重要的影響。

Your work-life balance is important. We focus on productivity and flexibility at work. We operate on a follow-the-sun model - we work in the daytime or early evening, and handover to other Support Engineering sites during the night. Some weeks are staggered, which means your working days may be either Sunday-Thursday, Monday-Friday, or Tuesday-Saturday. Engineers usually rotate between shift times and staggered weeks. Support Engineers have transparent work schedules, and do not need to join on-call rotations, or on-site customer meetings. You can discuss suitable workplace options (in-office, remote, or a combination) with your supervisor based on your development stage and needs.
你在工作和生活間的平衡是非常重要的。我們注重工作生產力與靈活性，所以在雲端工程師 (Support Engineering) 團隊裡，我們遵循 follow-the-sun 模式，期待你能靈活安排工作時間及地點。你沒有 on-call 或駐點客戶的需求，你更可根據發展階段及需求和主管討論合適的工作地點選項（辦公室/遠距/混合)；你的上班時間也會在週間內挪移 (週一 ~ 週五，週二 ~ 週六或是週日~週四)，於白天或稍晚時段工作，夜間時段則會交接給其他國家的團隊。


We value diversity and each person’s unique experience. Curiosity and passion for learning let us build and grow in an industry where our services, technology and customer requirements are constantly evolving. Thinking big, tenacity, and perseverance help us conquer challenges and work through ambiguity. We earn trust by treating others with respect, speaking candidly, and quickly admitting when we are wrong.

我們重視文化多樣性和每個人的獨特經歷。對學習的好奇心和熱情使我們能夠在服務、技術和客戶要求不斷發展的行業中成長和發展。大膽思考、堅韌不拔和毅力幫助我們克服挑戰並在不確定的狀況下完成工作。我們透過彼此尊重、坦誠相待並在錯誤時迅速承認來贏得信任。

What if I don’t have Cloud experience yet? That’s okay. You will be supported in your career development here at AWS. You will have plenty of opportunities to build your technical, leadership, and business skills. This will include formal and on the job training, and a chance to learn from and collaborate with some of the brightest technical minds in the industry today. We have an inclusive and friendly environment where our builders work together to create a culture whereby each of us is able to contribute fully to deliver the best customer outcome
如果我沒有雲端相關經驗怎麼辦? 沒關係。AWS 將全力支持你的職涯發展。你將透過完善的訓練課程、在職培訓 (OJT) 以及和全球頂尖工程師合作，學習最新的雲端技術、領導能力和商業技能。在AWS，我們重視並尊重不同的觀點，努力為我們的構建者營造一種可以讓每個人都能充分發揮潛能，為客戶提供最佳方案的文化。",30d+,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You will have plenty of opportunities to build your technical, leadership, and business skills. This will include formal and on the job training, and a chance to learn from and collaborate with some of the brightest technical minds in the industry today. We have an inclusive and friendly environment where our builders work together to create a culture whereby each of us is able to contribute fully to deliver the best customer outcome

We value diversity and each person’s unique experience. Curiosity and passion for learning let us build and grow in an industry where our services, technology and customer requirements are constantly evolving. Thinking big, tenacity, and perseverance help us conquer challenges and work through ambiguity.

We value diversity and each person’s unique experience. Curiosity and passion for learning let us build and grow in an industry where our services, technology and customer requirements are constantly evolving. Thinking big, tenacity, and perseverance help us conquer challenges and work through ambiguity. We earn trust by treating others with respect, speaking candidly, and quickly admitting when we are wrong.

Your work-life balance is important. We focus on productivity and flexibility at work. We operate on a follow-the-sun model - we work in the daytime or early evening, and handover to other Support Engineering sites during the night. Some weeks are staggered, which means your working days may be either Sunday-Thursday, Monday-Friday, or Tuesday-Saturday. Engineers usually rotate between shift times and staggered weeks. Support Engineers have transparent work schedules, and do not need to join on-call rotations, or on-site customer meetings. You can discuss suitable workplace options (in-office, remote, or a combination) with your supervisor based on your development stage and needs.

We value diversity and each person’s unique experience. Curiosity and passion for learning let us build and grow in an industry where our services, technology and customer requirements are constantly evolving. Thinking big, tenacity, and perseverance help us conquer challenges and work through ambiguity.

What if I don’t have Cloud experience yet? That’s okay. You will be supported in your career development here at AWS. You will have plenty of opportunities to build your technical, leadership, and business skills. This will include formal and on the job training, and a chance to learn from and collaborate with some of the brightest technical minds in the industry today. We have an inclusive and friendly environment where our builders work together to create a culture whereby each of us is able to contribute fully to deliver the best customer outcome
如果我沒有雲端相關經驗怎麼辦? 沒關係。AWS 將全力支持你的職涯發展。你將透過完善的訓練課程、在職培訓 (OJT) 以及和全球頂尖工程師合作，學習最新的雲端技術、領導能力和商業技能。在AWS，我們重視並尊重不同的觀點，努力為我們的構建者營造一種可以讓每個人都能充分發揮潛能，為客戶提供最佳方案的文化。",30d+,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We value diversity and each person’s unique experience. Curiosity and passion for learning let us build and grow in an industry where our services, technology and customer requirements are constantly evolving. Thinking big, tenacity, and perseverance help us conquer challenges and work through ambiguity.

What if I don’t have Cloud experience yet? That’s okay. You will be supported in your career development here at AWS. You will have plenty of opportunities to build your technical, leadership, and business skills. This will include formal and on the job training, and a chance to learn from and collaborate with some of the brightest technical minds in the industry today. We have an inclusive and friendly environment where our builders work together to create a culture whereby each of us is able to contribute fully to deliver the best customer outcome
如果我沒有雲端相關經驗怎麼辦? 沒關係。AWS 將全力支持你的職涯發展。你將透過完善的訓練課程、在職培訓 (OJT) 以及和全球頂尖工程師合作，學習最新的雲端技術、領導能力和商業技能。在AWS，我們重視並尊重不同的觀點，努力為我們的構建者營造一種可以讓每個人都能充分發揮潛能，為客戶提供最佳方案的文化。",30d+,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We value diversity and each person’s unique experience. Curiosity and passion for learning let us build and grow in an industry where our services, technology and customer requirements are constantly evolving.

身為 AWS 的雲端工程師，你有機會深化和拓展你的技術專長，和廣泛的客戶族群 — 小型新創公司到大型企業用戶 — 接觸，並享受工作與生活的平衡。

You will use your engineering expertise and skills to provide high quality technical solutions that help customers achieve their business goals. You dive deep into complex questions to find the root cause and ensure the customer’s specific requirements are fulfilled. Customers consult you about their plans and problems through various contact channels including telephone, email, and web/live chat. You listen carefully to fully understand each customer’s concerns and requirements. You guide customers by sharing facts that are backed by your troubleshooting findings and log data.
你需要運用專業知識提供客戶高品質的技術解決方案，幫助實現客戶的工作目標。你將深入探討複雜案件並找出根本原因以滿足客戶特定需求。客戶會透過電話、電子郵件和即時聊天軟體向你諮詢他們的計劃和問題。你必須充分了解每個客戶的需求及考量，並告知故障排除的結果以及提供數據資料來協助客戶解決問題。

All Cloud Engineers need to understand networking concepts such as network layers (the OSI model), IP connectivity, TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, and how to troubleshoot common connection issues. AWS new hire training includes these topics, so you will study these more during onboarding. Cloud Engineers at AWS Taipei need excellent communication skills in Mandarin, and intermediate English proficiency. Cloud Engineers will interact with customers and read training material in both Mandarin and English.
所有的雲端工程師都需具備基本的網路概念，例如網路層（OSI 模型）、IP 連接、TCP、UDP、DNS、HTTP，以及如何解決常見的網路連線問題。 AWS 的培訓課程將包括這些主題，所以你將在訓練時期學到更多。 此外，雲端工程師將與國內外客戶互動並閱讀中文/英文的培訓教材，所以你需具備出色的中文溝通能力和中等英語能力。

You’ll frequently co-work with Technical Account Managers, Solution Architects, and Business Development Managers to ensure solution alignment and excellent customer experience. You engage with subject matter expects and AWS service development teams across the world when needed. Every day will bring exciting challenges and include learning new skills. Mentorship and coaching are very important at AWS - Experienced Amazonians are on-hand to mentor you throughout your career at AWS. Support Engineers have the opportunity and resources to become certified subject matter experts. As you grow at AWS, there are various opportunities, including joining AWS teams abroad.
你會與 Technical Account Managers, Solution Architects 及 Business Development Managers 協助客戶解決問題並提供良好的顧客體驗；你也有機會和世界各地頂尖 Subject Matter Expects (SME) 和 AWS service development teams 一起完成目標。每天迎接新的挑戰並學習新的技術，不僅了解 AWS 的雲端服務如何運用在不同產業及規模的客戶端，更能接觸多樣化的使用情境。Mentorship 在 AWS 也十分重要，加入之後會有經驗豐富的亞馬遜人隨時提供指導。將來更有機會成為 subject matter experts (SME)。 不僅如此，隨著你在 AWS 的成長，我們提供多樣的職涯發展選擇，也包含海外 AWS 工作機會。

Although the majority of Taipei site’s customers prefer to communicate in Mandarin, some customers do require support in English. AWS Support Engineers frequently interact with international colleagues and study technical documentation in English. If you have a 3rd language skill, do let us know! Instructor led training may include classes in both Mandarin or English. Apart from working on a broad spectrum of technical issues, Support Engineers may also develop & host training, create technical articles, star in how-to videos, present at AWS events, participate in new hiring, write tools/scripts, or work with leadership on process improvement and strategic initiatives. At AWS, your contributions can bring significant positive impact to colleagues and customers globally.
在台灣絕大多數的客戶使用中文溝通，但我們還是需要用英文協助部分客戶。雲端工程師會經常與全球頂尖工程師們研究或討論英文技術文件，當然，如果你還會第三外語，歡迎讓我們知道！培訓的課程會涵蓋中文及英文。除了處理不同深度、廣度的技術問題外，雲端工程師可以制定或指導訓練課程、撰寫技術文章、在操作影片中擔任講者、出席 AWS 活動、參與招募流程、撰寫工具/腳本或更上一層進行流程改善及策略發想。在 AWS，你的貢獻可以為全球同事和客戶帶來重要的影響。

Are you curious how it’s possible to operate and rapidly evolve at such a large scale? At AWS, you have the opportunity to learn and practice the skills and techniques that make it possible.

AWS 已經建立了卓越的聲譽，我們的使命是成為地球上最以客戶為中心的公司，讓全球客戶認可、重視並信任我們的產品及服務。我們力圖賦予團隊成員權力，並承諾每個亞馬遜人的職涯發展皆能獲得成功。

Your work-life balance is important. We focus on productivity and flexibility at work. We operate on a follow-the-sun model - we work in the daytime or early evening, and handover to other Support Engineering sites during the night. Some weeks are staggered, which means your working days may be either Sunday-Thursday, Monday-Friday, or Tuesday-Saturday. Engineers usually rotate between shift times and staggered weeks. Support Engineers have transparent work schedules, and do not need to join on-call rotations, or on-site customer meetings. You can discuss suitable workplace options (in-office, remote, or a combination) with your supervisor based on your development stage and needs.
你在工作和生活間的平衡是非常重要的。我們注重工作生產力與靈活性，所以在雲端工程師 (Support Engineering) 團隊裡，我們遵循 follow-the-sun 模式，期待你能靈活安排工作時間及地點。你沒有 on-call 或駐點客戶的需求，你更可根據發展階段及需求和主管討論合適的工作地點選項（辦公室/遠距/混合)；你的上班時間也會在週間內挪移 (週一 ~ 週五，週二 ~ 週六或是週日~週四)，於白天或稍晚時段工作，夜間時段則會交接給其他國家的團隊。


We value diversity and each person’s unique experience. Curiosity and passion for learning let us build and grow in an industry where our services, technology and customer requirements are constantly evolving. Thinking big, tenacity, and perseverance help us conquer challenges and work through ambiguity. We earn trust by treating others with respect, speaking candidly, and quickly admitting when we are wrong.

我們重視文化多樣性和每個人的獨特經歷。對學習的好奇心和熱情使我們能夠在服務、技術和客戶要求不斷發展的行業中成長和發展。大膽思考、堅韌不拔和毅力幫助我們克服挑戰並在不確定的狀況下完成工作。我們透過彼此尊重、坦誠相待並在錯誤時迅速承認來贏得信任。

What if I don’t have Cloud experience yet? That’s okay. You will be supported in your career development here at AWS. You will have plenty of opportunities to build your technical, leadership, and business skills. This will include formal and on the job training, and a chance to learn from and collaborate with some of the brightest technical minds in the industry today. We have an inclusive and friendly environment where our builders work together to create a culture whereby each of us is able to contribute fully to deliver the best customer outcome
如果我沒有雲端相關經驗怎麼辦? 沒關係。AWS 將全力支持你的職涯發展。你將透過完善的訓練課程、在職培訓 (OJT) 以及和全球頂尖工程師合作，學習最新的雲端技術、領導能力和商業技能。在AWS，我們重視並尊重不同的觀點，努力為我們的構建者營造一種可以讓每個人都能充分發揮潛能，為客戶提供最佳方案的文化。",30d+,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

身為 AWS 的雲端工程師，你有機會深化和拓展你的技術專長，和廣泛的客戶族群 — 小型新創公司到大型企業用戶 — 接觸，並享受工作與生活的平衡。

You will use your engineering expertise and skills to provide high quality technical solutions that help customers achieve their business goals. You dive deep into complex questions to find the root cause and ensure the customer’s specific requirements are fulfilled. Customers consult you about their plans and problems through various contact channels including telephone, email, and web/live chat. You listen carefully to fully understand each customer’s concerns and requirements. You guide customers by sharing facts that are backed by your troubleshooting findings and log data.
你需要運用專業知識提供客戶高品質的技術解決方案，幫助實現客戶的工作目標。你將深入探討複雜案件並找出根本原因以滿足客戶特定需求。客戶會透過電話、電子郵件和即時聊天軟體向你諮詢他們的計劃和問題。你必須充分了解每個客戶的需求及考量，並告知故障排除的結果以及提供數據資料來協助客戶解決問題。

All Cloud Engineers need to understand networking concepts such as network layers (the OSI model), IP connectivity, TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, and how to troubleshoot common connection issues. AWS new hire training includes these topics, so you will study these more during onboarding. Cloud Engineers at AWS Taipei need excellent communication skills in Mandarin, and intermediate English proficiency. Cloud Engineers will interact with customers and read training material in both Mandarin and English.
所有的雲端工程師都需具備基本的網路概念，例如網路層（OSI 模型）、IP 連接、TCP、UDP、DNS、HTTP，以及如何解決常見的網路連線問題。 AWS 的培訓課程將包括這些主題，所以你將在訓練時期學到更多。 此外，雲端工程師將與國內外客戶互動並閱讀中文/英文的培訓教材，所以你需具備出色的中文溝通能力和中等英語能力。

You’ll frequently co-work with Technical Account Managers, Solution Architects, and Business Development Managers to ensure solution alignment and excellent customer experience. You engage with subject matter expects and AWS service development teams across the world when needed. Every day will bring exciting challenges and include learning new skills. Mentorship and coaching are very important at AWS - Experienced Amazonians are on-hand to mentor you throughout your career at AWS. Support Engineers have the opportunity and resources to become certified subject matter experts. As you grow at AWS, there are various opportunities, including joining AWS teams abroad.

Although the majority of Taipei site’s customers prefer to communicate in Mandarin, some customers do require support in English. AWS Support Engineers frequently interact with international colleagues and study technical documentation in English. If you have a 3rd language skill, do let us know! Instructor led training may include classes in both Mandarin or English.

AWS 已經建立了卓越的聲譽，我們的使命是成為地球上最以客戶為中心的公司，讓全球客戶認可、重視並信任我們的產品及服務。我們力圖賦予團隊成員權力，並承諾每個亞馬遜人的職涯發展皆能獲得成功。

Your work-life balance is important. We focus on productivity and flexibility at work. We operate on a follow-the-sun model - we work in the daytime or early evening, and handover to other Support Engineering sites during the night. Some weeks are staggered, which means your working days may be either Sunday-Thursday, Monday-Friday, or Tuesday-Saturday. Engineers usually rotate between shift times and staggered weeks. Support Engineers have transparent work schedules, and do not need to join on-call rotations, or on-site customer meetings. You can discuss suitable workplace options (in-office, remote, or a combination) with your supervisor based on your development stage and needs.
你在工作和生活間的平衡是非常重要的。我們注重工作生產力與靈活性，所以在雲端工程師 (Support Engineering) 團隊裡，我們遵循 follow-the-sun 模式，期待你能靈活安排工作時間及地點。你沒有 on-call 或駐點客戶的需求，你更可根據發展階段及需求和主管討論合適的工作地點選項（辦公室/遠距/混合)；你的上班時間也會在週間內挪移 (週一 ~ 週五，週二 ~ 週六或是週日~週四)，於白天或稍晚時段工作，夜間時段則會交接給其他國家的團隊。


We value diversity and each person’s unique experience. Curiosity and passion for learning let us build and grow in an industry where our services, technology and customer requirements are constantly evolving. Thinking big, tenacity, and perseverance help us conquer challenges and work through ambiguity. We earn trust by treating others with respect, speaking candidly, and quickly admitting when we are wrong.

What if I don’t have Cloud experience yet? That’s okay. You will be supported in your career development here at AWS. You will have plenty of opportunities to build your technical, leadership, and business skills. This will include formal and on the job training, and a chance to learn from and collaborate with some of the brightest technical minds in the industry today.

Your work-life balance is important. We focus on productivity and flexibility at work. We operate on a follow-the-sun model - we work in the daytime or early evening, and handover to other Support Engineering sites during the night. Some weeks are staggered, which means your working days may be either Sunday-Thursday, Monday-Friday, or Tuesday-Saturday. Engineers usually rotate between shift times and staggered weeks. Support Engineers have transparent work schedules, and do not need to join on-call rotations, or on-site customer meetings. You can discuss suitable workplace options (in-office, remote, or a combination) with your supervisor based on your development stage and needs.

We value diversity and each person’s unique experience. Curiosity and passion for learning let us build and grow in an industry where our services, technology and customer requirements are constantly evolving. Thinking big, tenacity, and perseverance help us conquer challenges and work through ambiguity. We earn trust by treating others with respect, speaking candidly, and quickly admitting when we are wrong.

We value diversity and each person’s unique experience. Curiosity and passion for learning let us build and grow in an industry where our services, technology and customer requirements are constantly evolving. Thinking big, tenacity, and perseverance help us conquer challenges and work through ambiguity.

What if I don’t have Cloud experience yet? That’s okay. You will be supported in your career development here at AWS. You will have plenty of opportunities to build your technical, leadership, and business skills. This will include formal and on the job training, and a chance to learn from and collaborate with some of the brightest technical minds in the industry today.

We value diversity and each person’s unique experience. Curiosity and passion for learning let us build and grow in an industry where our services, technology and customer requirements are constantly evolving. Thinking big, tenacity, and perseverance help us conquer challenges and work through ambiguity.
