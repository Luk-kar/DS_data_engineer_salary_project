Forsvarsministeriets Materiel- og Indkøbsstyrelse,,Ballerup,Koordinator til fremtidens BI Analytics platform i Forsvaret,"Vil du være et bærende element i en tid hvor cyber, digitalisering og data betyder mere dag for dag? Vi har brug for en engageret koordinator til den fremtidige udvikling af BI & Analytics, som skal være med til at opbygge Forsvarets data.

Business Intelligence og analytics området i Forsvarsministeriets koncern er klar til at tage det næste skridt på sin rejse mod at understøtte koncernen i at blive mere datadrevet.

Om os

Koncern IT er ansvarlig for at drive, vedligeholde og udvikle Forsvarets IT og i det hele taget digitalisere Forsvarsministeriets koncern. Organisationen tæller omkring 700 medarbejdere (ca. 1/3 militære og 2/3 civile) og er dermed blandt de største i den offentlige sektor.

I BI organisationen arbejder vi som et hold og deler både viden og ansvar, og vi har et godt arbejdsmiljø præget af humor, begejstring og gensidig respekt. Vi støtter hinanden i både opgaveløsningen, beslutningsfaserne og vidensdelingen. Du vil stå skulder mod skulder med erfarne og skarpe kolleger, som elsker at dele ud af deres viden og blive udfordret af nye ideer.



Du ansættes i DeMars Business Intelligence sektionen (DBI) som er en del af en BI organisation bestående af fastansatte medarbejdere både fra DBI og fra Departementets BI&A team samt eksterne IT konsulenter. Vi er opdelt i opgaveorienterede teams som i høj grad er selvbestemmende i forhold til opgaveprioriteringen. Stillingen som koordinator i BI vil i høj grad være en del af den tværgående koordinering i vores teams samt støtte til chef BI i forbindelse med administrative opgaver.

DBI har ansvaret for drift, vedligeholdelse og udvikling af Koncernens nuværende BI-platform som er en SAP-baseret Business Warehouse, Business Objects samt Celonis. Vi kigger samtidig på, hvad det naturlige næste skridt er i rejsen for at understøtte den digitale koncern vha. nye BI-værktøjer samt mulighederne i advanced analytics. Det ligger i forlængelse af Forsvarets vision om, at beslutninger i højere grad skal baseres på data.

Der er rig mulighed for at udvikle dig både fagligt og via udfordrende opgaver og opfølgende uddannelse inden for BI og analytics. Dette kan være igennem interne og eksterne kurser.



Din uddannelse er ikke afgørende, det vigtigste er, at du har gode kommunikations- og koordineringsevner og naturligt selvstændigt søger løsninger på udfordringer.

Som person trives du i et arbejdsmiljø, hvor der er fokus på rettidig gennemførsel af planlagte opgaver, samtidig med at prioriteringer i Forsvaret, kan ændre planerne med meget kort varsel.

Du er nysgerrig, har lyst til at lære og kommer med et stort engagement, som du kan bringe i spil. Dine berøringsflader er mange, så du får rig mulighed for udvikling i jobbet, både fagligt og personligt.

Afdelingens ansvarsområde spænder vidt og vi er i gang med en udvikling hen imod et større udvalg af analysemuligheder.

Erfaring med et eller flere af nedenstående teknologier, vil være et plus, men ikke krav:






I øvrigt skal du kunne udtrykke dig flydende på dansk i skrift og tale, ligesom du skal kunne læse og forstå teknisk engelsk.



Du ansættes og aflønnes efter den til enhver tid gældende relevante overenskomst. Der vil i forbindelse med en ansættelse være mulighed for forhandling af tillæg, der modsvarer dine kvalifikationer. Der er til stillingen tilknyttet en arbejdsgiverfinansieret pensionsordning.

Som ansat under Forsvarsministeriets område, er du omfattet af nogle særlige vilkår. Det betyder bl.a., at du skal kunne sikkerhedsgodkendes og opretholde denne gennem hele dit ansættelsesforhold.

Kontakt og ansøgning
Hvis du vil vide mere om stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte Chef for Business Intelligence sektionen Lotte Gjevnøe Mortensen, på FMI-C-CHTDB@MIL.DK eller på telefon 2557 4637.

Hvis du har spørgsmål til løn- og ansættelsesvilkår, er du velkommen til at kontakte Forsvarsministeriets Personalestyrelse, HR-konsulent Nathaly Tobiassen på telefon 3266 5698

Ansøgningsfristen er den 18.04.2023, og vi afholder samtaler løbende, så tøv ikke med at søge allerede i dag! Stillingen er til besættelse snarest muligt, gerne 01.05.2023.

Vi har brug for en engageret koordinator til den fremtidige udvikling af BI & Analytics, som skal være med til at opbygge Forsvarets data.

Business Intelligence og analytics området i Forsvarsministeriets koncern er klar til at tage det næste skridt på sin rejse mod at understøtte koncernen i at blive mere datadrevet.

Om os

Koncern IT er ansvarlig for at drive, vedligeholde og udvikle Forsvarets IT og i det hele taget digitalisere Forsvarsministeriets koncern. Organisationen tæller omkring 700 medarbejdere (ca. 1/3 militære og 2/3 civile) og er dermed blandt de største i den offentlige sektor.

I BI organisationen arbejder vi som et hold og deler både viden og ansvar, og vi har et godt arbejdsmiljø præget af humor, begejstring og gensidig respekt. Vi støtter hinanden i både opgaveløsningen, beslutningsfaserne og vidensdelingen. Du vil stå skulder mod skulder med erfarne og skarpe kolleger, som elsker at dele ud af deres viden og blive udfordret af nye ideer.



Du ansættes i DeMars Business Intelligence sektionen (DBI) som er en del af en BI organisation bestående af fastansatte medarbejdere både fra DBI og fra Departementets BI&A team samt eksterne IT konsulenter. Vi er opdelt i opgaveorienterede teams som i høj grad er selvbestemmende i forhold til opgaveprioriteringen. Stillingen som koordinator i BI vil i høj grad være en del af den tværgående koordinering i vores teams samt støtte til chef BI i forbindelse med administrative opgaver.

DBI har ansvaret for drift, vedligeholdelse og udvikling af Koncernens nuværende BI-platform som er en SAP-baseret Business Warehouse, Business Objects samt Celonis. Vi kigger samtidig på, hvad det naturlige næste skridt er i rejsen for at understøtte den digitale koncern vha. nye BI-værktøjer samt mulighederne i advanced analytics. Det ligger i forlængelse af Forsvarets vision om, at beslutninger i højere grad skal baseres på data.

Der er rig mulighed for at udvikle dig både fagligt og via udfordrende opgaver og opfølgende uddannelse inden for BI og analytics. Dette kan være igennem interne og eksterne kurser.



Din uddannelse er ikke afgørende, det vigtigste er, at du har gode kommunikations- og koordineringsevner og naturligt selvstændigt søger løsninger på udfordringer.

Som person trives du i et arbejdsmiljø, hvor der er fokus på rettidig gennemførsel af planlagte opgaver, samtidig med at prioriteringer i Forsvaret, kan ændre planerne med meget kort varsel.

Du er nysgerrig, har lyst til at lære og kommer med et stort engagement, som du kan bringe i spil. Dine berøringsflader er mange, så du får rig mulighed for udvikling i jobbet, både fagligt og personligt.

Afdelingens ansvarsområde spænder vidt og vi er i gang med en udvikling hen imod et større udvalg af analysemuligheder.

Erfaring med et eller flere af nedenstående teknologier, vil være et plus, men ikke krav:






I øvrigt skal du kunne udtrykke dig flydende på dansk i skrift og tale, ligesom du skal kunne læse og forstå teknisk engelsk.



Du ansættes og aflønnes efter den til enhver tid gældende relevante overenskomst. Der vil i forbindelse med en ansættelse være mulighed for forhandling af tillæg, der modsvarer dine kvalifikationer. Der er til stillingen tilknyttet en arbejdsgiverfinansieret pensionsordning.

Som ansat under Forsvarsministeriets område, er du omfattet af nogle særlige vilkår. Det betyder bl.a., at du skal kunne sikkerhedsgodkendes og opretholde denne gennem hele dit ansættelsesforhold.

Kontakt og ansøgning
Hvis du vil vide mere om stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte Chef for Business Intelligence sektionen Lotte Gjevnøe Mortensen, på FMI-C-CHTDB@MIL.DK eller på telefon 2557 4637.

What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

Center for Ejendomme,5.0,Herlev,Teamleder til ny analysefunktion i Region H,"Udadvendt akademiker til troværdige analyser og smart dataanvendelse.

Når direktion og fagchefer træffer langsigtede økonomiske beslutninger om hospitalsbyggerier og ejendomsdrift, skal de gøre det på baggrund af glasklare analyser, der bygger på solide data. Til dette arbejde opretter vi et nyt analyseteam.

Regionen forvalter 2 millioner kvadratmeter ejendomme, så selv mindre justeringer på byggerier eller ejendomsdrift kan have enorme økonomiske konsekvenser. Derfor opretter vi en ny data- og analyseenhed med i første omgang tre personer, der skal gøre det lettere for både controllere, fagchefer og direktion at træffe økonomiske beslutninger. Teamet bliver placeret centralt i økonomifunktionen hos Center for Ejendomme, der beskæftiger 1.000 medarbejdere og har et budget på 2,5 milliarder.

Teamet skal i første omgang bestå af tre personer med mulighed for at udvide teamet over tid. Medarbejderne er allerede på plads: Marie Louise er chefkonsulent og matematik-økonom med erfaring i økonomiske omkostningsmodeller og analyser til beslutningstagere. Frederik er fuldmægtig og ingeniør med stærke analytiske evner og indsigt i datamodellering via Power BI. Og så er der dig: Som ny teamleder skal du både bidrage fagligt til analyserne, være teamleder og øge samspillet med resten af organisationen.


Til at starte med skal du etablere en base for teamet i resten af organisationen samt skabe en god arbejdsdeling mellem jer tre. Herudover skal du sammen med teamet udvikle og være projektleder for:


Vi har allerede i dag masser af data, som økonomifunktionen faciliterer i velfungerende systemer for hele Center for Ejendomme. Men nogle data er redundante og skal opdateres særskilt, mens andre ikke er koblet tilstrækkeligt effektivt: Fx har vi ikke nok indsigt i, hvorvidt øgede energiudgifter primært skyldes stigende priser, eller at operationerne spredes over flere tider af døgnet. Den slags skal analyseteamet proaktivt belyse.


Der er mange veje til gode analyser. Vi forestiller os, at du er/har:


Selvom teamet arbejder med økonomiske analyser, behøver du ikke partout have en økonomisk baggrund. Det vigtigste er, at du kan lede os til dybdegående analyser, der gør det let for ledelsen at handle. Og at dit samspil med resten af organisationen udmønter sig i bedre brug af data.

This approach is also true for our processes: if you think we can optimise a process or a way of working, we strongly encourage you to share ideas with your team. In general, we try to be pragmatic: we use SCRUM but are not fanatical about it. Things must make sense. If not, we change it. We plan our tasks in two-week sprints, but we are agile and can reprioritise as and when required.

Center for Ejendomme,5.0,Herlev,Teamleder til ny analysefunktion i Region H,"Udadvendt akademiker til troværdige analyser og smart dataanvendelse.

Når direktion og fagchefer træffer langsigtede økonomiske beslutninger om hospitalsbyggerier og ejendomsdrift, skal de gøre det på baggrund af glasklare analyser, der bygger på solide data. Til dette arbejde opretter vi et nyt analyseteam.

Regionen forvalter 2 millioner kvadratmeter ejendomme, så selv mindre justeringer på byggerier eller ejendomsdrift kan have enorme økonomiske konsekvenser. Derfor opretter vi en ny data- og analyseenhed med i første omgang tre personer, der skal gøre det lettere for både controllere, fagchefer og direktion at træffe økonomiske beslutninger. Teamet bliver placeret centralt i økonomifunktionen hos Center for Ejendomme, der beskæftiger 1.000 medarbejdere og har et budget på 2,5 milliarder.

Teamet skal i første omgang bestå af tre personer med mulighed for at udvide teamet over tid. Medarbejderne er allerede på plads: Marie Louise er chefkonsulent og matematik-økonom med erfaring i økonomiske omkostningsmodeller og analyser til beslutningstagere. Frederik er fuldmægtig og ingeniør med stærke analytiske evner og indsigt i datamodellering via Power BI. Og så er der dig: Som ny teamleder skal du både bidrage fagligt til analyserne, være teamleder og øge samspillet med resten af organisationen.


Til at starte med skal du etablere en base for teamet i resten af organisationen samt skabe en god arbejdsdeling mellem jer tre. Herudover skal du sammen med teamet udvikle og være projektleder for:


Vi har allerede i dag masser af data, som økonomifunktionen faciliterer i velfungerende systemer for hele Center for Ejendomme. Men nogle data er redundante og skal opdateres særskilt, mens andre ikke er koblet tilstrækkeligt effektivt: Fx har vi ikke nok indsigt i, hvorvidt øgede energiudgifter primært skyldes stigende priser, eller at operationerne spredes over flere tider af døgnet. Den slags skal analyseteamet proaktivt belyse.


Der er mange veje til gode analyser. Vi forestiller os, at du er/har:


Selvom teamet arbejder med økonomiske analyser, behøver du ikke partout have en økonomisk baggrund. Det vigtigste er, at du kan lede os til dybdegående analyser, der gør det let for ledelsen at handle. Og at dit samspil med resten af organisationen udmønter sig i bedre brug af data.
