We believe that we can only build the very best software through working with each other, seeking different perspectives to solve problems. We have just started on our journey to unlock the value in the data we collect, helping to connect the dots between incidents and work towards preventing crime in real time.

Improving our operability and working with other engineers to ensure that key observability & reliability aspects are in place during the development process and ongoing into production
Operate within compliance frameworks such as SOC2

You’ll be reporting to Shahid Iqbal, Principal Platform Architect

I changed careers into software development back in 2008 and started getting paid to do my hobby. Although I continued with software development for over a decade I started getting more involved in cloud architecture from the early days of Azure. The Cloud is a huge enabler, in particular to make the lives of developers better; that naturally led me down the route of Cloud architecture, DevOps and other related disciplines.

I joined Auror in 2021 moving from the UK to join the team here in Auckland. I love coming up with creative solutions to problems we're facing, empowering the team and sharing knowledge by speaking at events both internally and conferences/meetups. Outside of work I enjoy being outdoors and taking photos and have a passion for cars and awesome tech in general. Check out my LinkedIn here.

Requirements


Prior experience working with cloud infrastructure. Azure experience is advantageous but not essential.
A proactive approach to spotting problems, areas for improvement, and performance bottlenecks
Strong analytical & systems thinking skills.
Openness in sharing your knowledge with the team through various channels such as recorded demos, meetings, 1:1s
Comfortable working both independently on self-directed projects, as well as in close collaboration with other teams & stakeholders.
A deep desire to automate as much as possible with experience of tools such as Git and scripting languages such as PowerShell
Have a secure by design mindset
An understanding of or desire to learn general purpose programming languages such as C#, Typescript would be beneficial for this role
Familiar with CI/CD tooling such as GitHub Actions, Octopus Deploy and general development processes/workflows.
Experience with IaC tools such as Terraform, Bicep or Pulumi would be advantageous for this role.

We are looking for people who demonstrate a strong alignment to our Guiding Principles (you can find these on our Careers page).

With diversity and inclusion at the forefront of Aurors guiding principles, we promote a culture that celebrates diversity and inclusiveness at Auror, regardless of, but not limited to, race, gender, sexual orientation, family status, religion, ethnicity, national origin, physical disability, veteran status, or age.

Benefits
You’ll own part of a company making a real difference!
We are hard-working and outcome focused, but recognize there is more to life than work. We promote a healthy work/life blend.
Everyone gets Friday afternoon’s off, so you can start your weekend early, and do more of whatever it is that makes you happy.
We understand how vital both mental and physical health is, and have policies to support that, including Wellness Days (days that you can take for any reason whatsoever, not just for when you’re sick/ unwell).
We offer comprehensive parental leave and benefits for primary and non-primary caregivers.
We support our team to participate in courses, conferences, or events that will help them be relentless about improvement.

You’ll be reporting to Shahid Iqbal, Principal Platform Architect

I changed careers into software development back in 2008 and started getting paid to do my hobby. Although I continued with software development for over a decade I started getting more involved in cloud architecture from the early days of Azure. The Cloud is a huge enabler, in particular to make the lives of developers better; that naturally led me down the route of Cloud architecture, DevOps and other related disciplines.

I joined Auror in 2021 moving from the UK to join the team here in Auckland. I love coming up with creative solutions to problems we're facing, empowering the team and sharing knowledge by speaking at events both internally and conferences/meetups. Outside of work I enjoy being outdoors and taking photos and have a passion for cars and awesome tech in general. Check out my LinkedIn here.

Requirements


Prior experience working with cloud infrastructure. Azure experience is advantageous but not essential.
A proactive approach to spotting problems, areas for improvement, and performance bottlenecks
Strong analytical & systems thinking skills.
Openness in sharing your knowledge with the team through various channels such as recorded demos, meetings, 1:1s
Comfortable working both independently on self-directed projects, as well as in close collaboration with other teams & stakeholders.
A deep desire to automate as much as possible with experience of tools such as Git and scripting languages such as PowerShell
Have a secure by design mindset
An understanding of or desire to learn general purpose programming languages such as C#, Typescript would be beneficial for this role
Familiar with CI/CD tooling such as GitHub Actions, Octopus Deploy and general development processes/workflows.

We are looking for people who demonstrate a strong alignment to our Guiding Principles (you can find these on our Careers page).

With diversity and inclusion at the forefront of Aurors guiding principles, we promote a culture that celebrates diversity and inclusiveness at Auror, regardless of, but not limited to, race, gender, sexual orientation, family status, religion, ethnicity, national origin, physical disability, veteran status, or age.

Benefits
You’ll own part of a company making a real difference!
We are hard-working and outcome focused, but recognize there is more to life than work. We promote a healthy work/life blend.
Everyone gets Friday afternoon’s off, so you can start your weekend early, and do more of whatever it is that makes you happy.
We understand how vital both mental and physical health is, and have policies to support that, including Wellness Days (days that you can take for any reason whatsoever, not just for when you’re sick/ unwell).

Auror,5.0,Auckland,Product Manager,"Description

About Auror

At Auror, we’re empowering the retail industry to reduce theft and Organized Retail Crime, a $150 billion problem globally. It’s high volume crime that’s increasingly organized in nature and is putting people, retailers, and communities at risk every day.

Founded in New Zealand, we’re working with some of the best and largest retailers in the world across Australasia, North America, and the UK.

Auror connects people with intelligence to reduce crime. As a company, we’ve built a high-performing, positive culture with a focus on providing an inclusive environment for a diverse team. If you’re excited about reducing crime and building safer communities, for everyone, then we want you on our team.

The Role

Taking the lessons learned from our customers, the police and the industry overall, we built a new, easy-to-use, high performing, and scalable platform to take Auror to the rest of the world. We’re now building on this foundation and have big plans for the future.

As a company we’re all actively collaborating to make our product exceptional and we’re looking for someone to come in and work with our product, UX, design, engineering, and QA teams to evolve the Auror platform to better meet the needs of our current and future customers.

We’re a growing company so in this role you can expect your day to day to include;

Working with customers and users to ensure we understand the problems they’re facing, and sharing that context with the work stream/s you look after
Exploring and experimenting to maximise the impact the work we do has on solving customer problems
Diving into the detail of the work the work stream/s you support are doing all the way from discovery to delivery and post-release analysis
Working with other Product Managers, Designers, Software Engineers, and QA, to clearly define epics / features / user stories
Collaborating with key partners to manage roadmaps for the workstream/s you look after that support our wider company goals
Being a key driver and motivating the work stream teams you look after to ship value frequently
Measuring impact of changes made once in the hands of users, and iterating to maximise value

In your first 90 days you’ll be tasked with developing a thorough understanding of the market we work in, and getting a good big picture of where we’re heading. You’ll need to have a clear view of the problems to be solved, and the current scope, but also a good understanding of the things that are still unknown. There will be lots of finer details to dig into so you will be spending time researching and refining.

This role reports to Heather Legg, Director of Product

I stumbled into Product after 5 years in market research, user research roles and analytics. I quickly found Product Management to be the happy place in my venn diagram; an overlapping of being able to learn deeply about other people and their lives, with the creative juice and excitement of being able to create awesome things. This drive to understand and create is a pattern I see in many things that energise me; at home it's being channelled through my dog Emmie, who I'm adamant about training into a super-dog. In my hobbies it comes through in my love of discovering and creating new and interesting foods. At work it comes through in a passion to make products that solve real problems in a way that sparks excitement in our users.As a general rule I am most animated when I'm problem solving surrounded by kind and ambitious people, and what better place to do it that than at Auror. We have a team of superstars who are empowering retailers and Police globally to stop crime, for good. You can check out my LinkedIn here.

Requirements

To ace this role you will;

Have a highly collaborative approach and enjoy mentoring other members of the team
Be deeply curious about the wider Auror experience and how it fits into the loss prevention landscape
Have experience using data to drive areas of improvement and product strategy
Be customer obsessed and can effectively define the discovery we need across a range of product areas to answer questions that will help us solve the right problems at the right time
Be familiar with working with software development teams and running SaaS projects;
Be comfortable talking to customers and stakeholders;
Have an ability to see the problem to be solved without immediately jumping to a solution, and to share context with the team so that all possible approaches can be surfaced;
Be pragmatic, with an understanding and appreciation for working in an ever changing environment;
Have exceptional organisational and analytical skills, along with attention to detail.
Have excellent written and verbal communication skills

We are looking for people who demonstrate a strong alignment to our Guiding Principles (you can find these on our Careers page).

With diversity and inclusion at the forefront of Aurors guiding principles, we promote a culture that celebrates diversity and inclusiveness at Auror, regardless of, but not limited to, race, gender, sexual orientation, family status, religion, ethnicity, national origin, physical disability, veteran status, or age.

Benefits
You’ll own part of a company making a real difference!
We are hard-working and outcome focused, but recognize there is more to life than work. We promote a healthy work/life blend.
Everyone gets Friday afternoon’s off, so you can start your weekend early, and do more of whatever it is that makes you happy.
We understand how vital both mental and physical health is, and have policies to support that, including Wellness Days (days that you can take for any reason whatsoever, not just for when you’re sick/ unwell).
We offer comprehensive parental leave and benefits for primary and non-primary caregivers.
We support our team to participate in courses, conferences, or events that will help them be relentless about improvement.
