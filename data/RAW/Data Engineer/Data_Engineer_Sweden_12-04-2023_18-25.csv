There are many consumer facing fintech products, but finance as a whole is virtually untouched by technology. Investment decisions are still being made off of pdf’s and “shark tank”-like processes rather than utilising the forecasting methods found at companies like Spotify or Google. This makes capital allocation riddled with bias and very ripe for disruption. At ArK we’re convinced that by putting data and tech at the heart of finance we can impact how money flows and, in turn, create a more democratised and unbiased economy.
Today we offer founders access to our machine learning platform AIM. Through connecting their raw data we can fully understand what they’ve built without any bias; connecting what has been achieved historically into a simulated 5-year future.

There are many consumer-facing fintech products, but finance as a whole is virtually untouched by technology. Investment decisions are still being made off of pdf’s and “shark tank”-like processes rather than utilizing the forecasting methods found at companies like Spotify or Google. This makes capital allocation riddled with bias and very ripe for disruption. At ArK we’re convinced that by putting data and tech at the heart of finance we can impact how money flows and, in turn, create a more democratized and unbiased economy.
Today we offer founders access to our machine learning platform AIM. Through connecting their raw data we can fully understand what they’ve built without any bias; connecting what has been achieved historically into a simulated 5-year future.

Ark Kapital,,Stockholm,Junior Infrastructure Engineer,"What is ArK?
There are many consumer-facing fintech products, but finance as a whole is virtually untouched by technology. Investment decisions are still being made off of PDFs and “shark tank”-like processes rather than utilising the forecasting methods found at companies like Spotify or Google. This makes capital allocation riddled with bias and very ripe for disruption. At ArK we’re convinced that by putting data and tech at the heart of finance we can impact how money flows and, in turn, create a more democratised and unbiased economy.
Today we offer founders access to our machine learning platform AIM. Through connecting their raw data we can fully understand what they’ve built without any bias; connecting what has been achieved historically into a simulated 5-year future.

Humblebee,4.4,Gothenburg,Hive Student Lab - Internship,"We are looking for 5 talents that will form our Hive student lab team. The goal is to get a good mix of UX designers, Developers, (digital) Product Designers, Service designers and Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer.

The Hive team will be responsible for driving a user-centered design process to explore a defined opportunity space together with a partner company and developing a digital service. The process usually follows Humblebee's way of working:

Starting with rapid field research to understand the user's needs and pains, which hopefully opens a gap in the market where we can develop a digital service. Then using an array of user journey creation tools and ideation techniques we build prioritised prototypes that are visually ready for testing. To validate our prototypes as effectively and quickly as possible we test on real users and make sure we get the most valuable feedback possible. Based upon our user testings & findings we are able to pivot and iterate our prototype accordingly. Simultaneously with our prototyping process we start designing a business model to make sure the idea has concrete financial foundations. The Hive project should end up not with a minimum viable product (MVP) but a minimun delightful product. We ensure our MVP’s are MDP’s. Pixel sharp and crafted with care.

Although you - the Hivers - are responsible for the process, you will get the best support from the rest of the Humblebee staff. The Hive team have their desks right in the heart of the Humblebee office and every Hiver is assigned a personal mentor for the entire Hive journey.

De sökte själva efter ett HR-system till ett av sina bolag men kunde inte hitta ett system som uppfyllde deras krav, så de bestämde sig helt enkelt för att bygga systemet de sökte efter själva! De har nått stor framgång och är idag ett team på 45 personer med lång erfarenhet av både HR och tech som vill digitalisera och modernisera HR-branschen.

Just nu är Hailey i en mycket spännande tillväxtfas där de dels expanderar till fler marknader utomlands, och dels förstärker Sverige-teamet för att kunna möta den stora efterfrågan som finns på marknaden.

Haileys heltäckande HR-plattform täcker hela medarbetarresan; anställning, preboarding, performance, surveys, analytics, offboarding etc. Hailey hjälper sina kunder att effektivisera sina kunders arbetssätt och processer på ett sätt som ligger i tiden. Hailey utmanar och digitaliserar helt enkelt det traditionella HR-arbetet.





För att lyckas i rollen på Hailey HR tar du stort ägandeskap för dina arbetsuppgifter, ser till att utförandet bli bra och säkerställer att allt blir slutfört i tid. Du kan göra det eftersom du planerar ditt arbete noggrant och ber om stöttning när det behövs, men du kan också fatta bra beslut när det saknas underlag. Det är viktigt för dig att göra ett bra jobb och du planerar dina uppgifter noggrant innan du sätter igång. Samtidigt är du den som alltid ställer upp och stöttar andra, oavsett om det ingår i dina arbetsuppgifter eller inte. Vidare är du den som ser till att saker blir gjorda och är inte rädd för att ta egna initiativ för att nå dit du vill.",26d,False,,501 to 1000,Company - Private,,,,,0.59,,3.2,2.5,3.1,2.5,3.7,"['""fun, young colleagues.""

Den här tjänsten är en direktrekrytering vilket innebär att rekryteringsprocessen sker genom Bravura och du anställs direkt hos Hailey HR.
Om företaget
Hailey är ett SaaS HR-tech startup som grundades våren 2020 av en grupp ingenjörer och entreprenörer med flera framgångsrika företagsbyggen bakom sig. De sökte själva efter ett HR-system till ett av sina bolag men kunde inte hitta ett system som uppfyllde deras krav, så de bestämde sig helt enkelt för att bygga systemet de sökte efter själva! De har nått stor framgång och är idag ett team på 45 personer med lång erfarenhet av både HR och tech som vill digitalisera och modernisera HR-branschen.

Just nu är Hailey i en mycket spännande tillväxtfas där de dels expanderar till fler marknader utomlands, och dels förstärker Sverige-teamet för att kunna möta den stora efterfrågan som finns på marknaden.

Haileys heltäckande HR-plattform täcker hela medarbetarresan; anställning, preboarding, performance, surveys, analytics, offboarding etc. Hailey hjälper sina kunder att effektivisera sina kunders arbetssätt och processer på ett sätt som ligger i tiden. Hailey utmanar och digitaliserar helt enkelt det traditionella HR-arbetet.





För att lyckas i rollen på Hailey HR tar du stort ägandeskap för dina arbetsuppgifter, ser till att utförandet bli bra och säkerställer att allt blir slutfört i tid. Du kan göra det eftersom du planerar ditt arbete noggrant och ber om stöttning när det behövs, men du kan också fatta bra beslut när det saknas underlag. Det är viktigt för dig att göra ett bra jobb och du planerar dina uppgifter noggrant innan du sätter igång. Samtidigt är du den som alltid ställer upp och stöttar andra, oavsett om det ingår i dina arbetsuppgifter eller inte.

Hailey är ett SaaS HR-tech startup som grundades våren 2020 av en grupp ingenjörer och entreprenörer med flera framgångsrika företagsbyggen bakom sig.

Hailey är ett SaaS HR-tech startup som grundades våren 2020 av en grupp ingenjörer och entreprenörer med flera framgångsrika företagsbyggen bakom sig.

Hailey utmanar och digitaliserar helt enkelt det traditionella HR-arbetet.





För att lyckas i rollen på Hailey HR tar du stort ägandeskap för dina arbetsuppgifter, ser till att utförandet bli bra och säkerställer att allt blir slutfört i tid.

Om företaget
Hailey är ett SaaS HR-tech startup som grundades våren 2020 av en grupp ingenjörer och entreprenörer med flera framgångsrika företagsbyggen bakom sig. De sökte själva efter ett HR-system till ett av sina bolag men kunde inte hitta ett system som uppfyllde deras krav, så de bestämde sig helt enkelt för att bygga systemet de sökte efter själva! De har nått stor framgång och är idag ett team på 45 personer med lång erfarenhet av både HR och tech som vill digitalisera och modernisera HR-branschen.

Just nu är Hailey i en mycket spännande tillväxtfas där de dels expanderar till fler marknader utomlands, och dels förstärker Sverige-teamet för att kunna möta den stora efterfrågan som finns på marknaden.

Haileys heltäckande HR-plattform täcker hela medarbetarresan; anställning, preboarding, performance, surveys, analytics, offboarding etc. Hailey hjälper sina kunder att effektivisera sina kunders arbetssätt och processer på ett sätt som ligger i tiden. Hailey utmanar och digitaliserar helt enkelt det traditionella HR-arbetet.





För att lyckas i rollen på Hailey HR tar du stort ägandeskap för dina arbetsuppgifter, ser till att utförandet bli bra och säkerställer att allt blir slutfört i tid. Du kan göra det eftersom du planerar ditt arbete noggrant och ber om stöttning när det behövs, men du kan också fatta bra beslut när det saknas underlag. Det är viktigt för dig att göra ett bra jobb och du planerar dina uppgifter noggrant innan du sätter igång.

Bravura,3.2,Stockholm,Legal & Compliance Specialist / GDPR & informationssäkerhet till Hailey HR,"Om tjänsten
Den här tjänsten är en direktrekrytering vilket innebär att rekryteringsprocessen sker genom Bravura och du anställs direkt hos Hailey HR.
Om företaget
Hailey är ett SaaS HR-tech startup som grundades våren 2020 av en grupp ingenjörer och entreprenörer med flera framgångsrika företagsbyggen bakom sig. De sökte själva efter ett HR-system till ett av sina bolag men kunde inte hitta ett system som uppfyllde deras krav, så de bestämde sig helt enkelt för att bygga systemet de sökte efter själva! De har nått stor framgång och är idag ett team på 45 personer med lång erfarenhet av både HR och tech som vill digitalisera och modernisera HR-branschen.

Just nu är Hailey i en mycket spännande tillväxtfas där de dels expanderar till fler marknader utomlands, och dels förstärker Sverige-teamet för att kunna möta den stora efterfrågan som finns på marknaden.

Haileys heltäckande HR-plattform täcker hela medarbetarresan; anställning, preboarding, performance, surveys, analytics, offboarding etc. Hailey hjälper sina kunder att effektivisera sina kunders arbetssätt och processer på ett sätt som ligger i tiden. Hailey utmanar och digitaliserar helt enkelt det traditionella HR-arbetet.





För att lyckas i rollen på Hailey HR tar du stort ägandeskap för dina arbetsuppgifter, ser till att utförandet bli bra och säkerställer att allt blir slutfört i tid. Du kan göra det eftersom du planerar ditt arbete noggrant och ber om stöttning när det behövs, men du kan också fatta bra beslut när det saknas underlag. Det är viktigt för dig att göra ett bra jobb och du planerar dina uppgifter noggrant innan du sätter igång. Samtidigt är du den som alltid ställer upp och stöttar andra, oavsett om det ingår i dina arbetsuppgifter eller inte. Vidare är du den som ser till att saker blir gjorda och är inte rädd för att ta egna initiativ för att nå dit du vill.",26d,False,,501 to 1000,Company - Private,,,,,0.59,,3.2,2.5,3.1,2.5,3.7,"['""fun, young colleagues.""

Om företaget
Hailey är ett SaaS HR-tech startup som grundades våren 2020 av en grupp ingenjörer och entreprenörer med flera framgångsrika företagsbyggen bakom sig. De sökte själva efter ett HR-system till ett av sina bolag men kunde inte hitta ett system som uppfyllde deras krav, så de bestämde sig helt enkelt för att bygga systemet de sökte efter själva! De har nått stor framgång och är idag ett team på 45 personer med lång erfarenhet av både HR och tech som vill digitalisera och modernisera HR-branschen.

Just nu är Hailey i en mycket spännande tillväxtfas där de dels expanderar till fler marknader utomlands, och dels förstärker Sverige-teamet för att kunna möta den stora efterfrågan som finns på marknaden.

Haileys heltäckande HR-plattform täcker hela medarbetarresan; anställning, preboarding, performance, surveys, analytics, offboarding etc. Hailey hjälper sina kunder att effektivisera sina kunders arbetssätt och processer på ett sätt som ligger i tiden. Hailey utmanar och digitaliserar helt enkelt det traditionella HR-arbetet.





För att lyckas i rollen på Hailey HR tar du stort ägandeskap för dina arbetsuppgifter, ser till att utförandet bli bra och säkerställer att allt blir slutfört i tid. Du kan göra det eftersom du planerar ditt arbete noggrant och ber om stöttning när det behövs, men du kan också fatta bra beslut när det saknas underlag.

Bravura,3.2,Stockholm,Legal & Compliance Specialist / GDPR & informationssäkerhet till Hailey HR,"Om tjänsten
Den här tjänsten är en direktrekrytering vilket innebär att rekryteringsprocessen sker genom Bravura och du anställs direkt hos Hailey HR.
Om företaget
Hailey är ett SaaS HR-tech startup som grundades våren 2020 av en grupp ingenjörer och entreprenörer med flera framgångsrika företagsbyggen bakom sig. De sökte själva efter ett HR-system till ett av sina bolag men kunde inte hitta ett system som uppfyllde deras krav, så de bestämde sig helt enkelt för att bygga systemet de sökte efter själva! De har nått stor framgång och är idag ett team på 45 personer med lång erfarenhet av både HR och tech som vill digitalisera och modernisera HR-branschen.

Just nu är Hailey i en mycket spännande tillväxtfas där de dels expanderar till fler marknader utomlands, och dels förstärker Sverige-teamet för att kunna möta den stora efterfrågan som finns på marknaden.

Haileys heltäckande HR-plattform täcker hela medarbetarresan; anställning, preboarding, performance, surveys, analytics, offboarding etc. Hailey hjälper sina kunder att effektivisera sina kunders arbetssätt och processer på ett sätt som ligger i tiden. Hailey utmanar och digitaliserar helt enkelt det traditionella HR-arbetet.





För att lyckas i rollen på Hailey HR tar du stort ägandeskap för dina arbetsuppgifter, ser till att utförandet bli bra och säkerställer att allt blir slutfört i tid. Du kan göra det eftersom du planerar ditt arbete noggrant och ber om stöttning när det behövs, men du kan också fatta bra beslut när det saknas underlag. Det är viktigt för dig att göra ett bra jobb och du planerar dina uppgifter noggrant innan du sätter igång. Samtidigt är du den som alltid ställer upp och stöttar andra, oavsett om det ingår i dina arbetsuppgifter eller inte.
