Working directly with the analysts and the product lead, the data engineer identifies and implements solutions for the data requirements, including building pipelines to collect data from disparate, external sources, implementing rules to validate that expected data is received, cleansed, transformed, massaged and in an optimized output format for the data store.

The Data Engineer performs validation and analytics corresponding with client requirements and evolves solutions through automation, optimizing performance with minimal human involvement. As pipelines are executed, the data engineer monitors their status, performance, and troubleshoots issues while working on improvements to ensure the solution is the very best version to address the customer need.

Working directly with the analysts and the product lead, the data engineer identifies and implements solutions for the data requirements, including building pipelines to collect data from disparate, external sources, implementing rules to validate that expected data is received, cleansed, transformed, massaged and in an optimized output format for the data store.

The Data Engineer performs validation and analytics corresponding with client requirements and evolves solutions through automation, optimizing performance with minimal human involvement. As pipelines are executed, the data engineer monitors their status, performance, and troubleshoots issues while working on improvements to ensure the solution is the very best version to address the customer need.
