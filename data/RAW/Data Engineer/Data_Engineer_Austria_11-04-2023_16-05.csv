„We build digital products and platforms that humans love and businesses need”

Nur wer bereit ist, sich zu verändern und sich mit dem Neuen und Unbekannten auseinanderzusetzen, wird der Treiber dieser Welt sein. Bestehende Konventionen — genauso wie das eigens Erschaffene — in Frage zu stellen und nie den Anspruch zu verlieren, das Bestehende zu verbessern, ist tief in uns verankert; denn auch unser eigenes Handeln unterliegt diesem Naturgesetz.
Disruption entsteht, weil nichts perfekt ist, nichts ewig Bestand hat. Alles kann besser werden. Alles ist BETA — auch dieser Gedanke.
Die Gier nach Neuem treibt uns an, hinter die Dinge zu schauen und die Zusammenhänge und Mechaniken der digitalen Welt zu verstehen. Wir bringen mit unserem Feuer Licht in dieses Dunkel und stecken unsere Partner und Mitmenschen damit an, sich mehr für die Potenziale und Chancen dieser Veränderung zu begeistern, anstatt sich von deren Risiken lähmen zu lassen

Bei uns wirst Du Dich und Deine Talente entfalten, Dein Wissen und deine Fähigkeiten einbringen und von anderen lernen.

The primary role of the Department is to develop and implement IAEA safeguards to ensure that there is no diversion of declared nuclear material from peaceful activities and no indications of undeclared nuclear material or activities in a State as a whole.

The Department comprises nuclear safeguards inspectors, responsible for carrying out inspections and verifications of all-safeguards relevant information for nuclear facilities in over 180 States; and technical staff responsible for a wide range of activities including: developing concepts and approaches for implementing safeguards; developing and maintaining safeguards equipment; providing analytical and laboratory services for sample analysis; collecting, evaluating and analysing safeguards-relevant information; providing information and communication technology infrastructure and services; and providing programme coordination support.

The Division of Technical and Scientific Services ensures the provision of state-of-the-art equipment and related expertise for the accomplishment of the Department of Safeguards activities. Within this mandate, the Division is responsible for procurement, testing, provision, inventory control, performance monitoring and maintenance of safeguards equipment and supplies required by SGO Divisions; management of equipment development and engineering activities to meet quality and safeguards requirements; development and provision of documentation, procedures, instrumentation methods and techniques; provision of specialized technical and scientific support to inspectors and inspection activities in the field and at headquarters; and, radiation contamination monitoring of returned equipment and timely write-off of obsolete or contaminated equipment. The Division also coordinates departmental health and safety activities.",30d+,False,,1001 to 5000,Nonprofit Organization,Nonprofit & NGO,1957,Civic & Social Services,,0.89,0.75,3.4,4.4,4.0,3.4,3.4,"['""Pay and benefits for UN salary scale is good.""
