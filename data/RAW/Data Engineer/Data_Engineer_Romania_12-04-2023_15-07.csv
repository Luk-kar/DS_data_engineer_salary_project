Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.
Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

Booking Holdings,4.1,Bucharest,Site Reliability Engineer,"The core premise for SRE lies in treating operations as a software problem where operations are concerned with addressing availability, scalability, latency and efficiency for Booking.com's systems and services. At its core the SRE is tasked with engineering efforts to solve complex problems, requiring a strong aptitude to develop software systems that will minimize (i.e. through automation) human labor and increase system and service reliability. A Booking Reliability Engineering team has full vertical ownership of a system, from the server configuration up to the application interfaces. This enables the team to have full control on a service, and avoid situations where different teams own different areas of a system and some parts fall between the cracks.

SRE can wear several hats; at times an SRE might be part of the product development team themselves and other times will act as a consultant to support a product development team to implement the Booking Reliability Engineering best practices. As systems and services grow in size and complexity so too does the operational overhead. It is a fundamental principle of SRE to break this relationship between operational toil, system size and complexity. This also requires the team toA limit operations work enforcing engineering development efforts that is at the heart of Booking Reliability Engineering.

Ultimately the fundamental software engineering skills coupled with strong systems and networking knowledge will guide the SRE to create more reliable systems and services that are highly available, which scales with growth and that is efficient and latency sensitive.

The best way to get us there is city logistics. Electric vehicles, particularly light ones, are used in combination with urban hubs or brick-and-mortar stores to reduce CO2 emissions by 95%, lighten the traffic and pollution burden on our cities, and cut vehicle costs by half.
At Palmo, we are building the software layer for city logistics—a marketplace that will enable shippers (e.g. e-commerce retailers or national carriers) to connect to a single API and get millions of their parcels moved seamlessly through major cities, do so sustainably, and at a fraction of today's cost.

️ The technical challenge is immense. Vast numbers of retailers, fleets, vehicles, and warehouses need to be connected. Additionally, we have to orchestrate the efficient and automatic movement of thousands of parcels in real-time, using purpose-built optimisation algorithms and machine learning.

Currently, we are building the core technology called PalmoDMS and onboarding initial partners.

We are a small team of experienced builders and have offices in Berlin and Bucharest, though we are also open to outstanding remote profiles.
Having raised our first round of funding from top VCs & angel investors, we are now looking to build a world-class engineering team.
If you care about our mission, are deeply passionate about your work, and want to shape a high-growth startup from day 1, we’d like to talk.

Tasks

We are looking for an exceptional and experienced Full Stack Engineer.
You'll report directly to the CTO and have ownership and responsibility over key areas of our product and technology. As one of our first colleagues, you will be crucial in shaping Palmo’s success and culture. We are looking for a generalist who is excited at the prospect of mastering new technologies to solve business problems and will enjoy the thrills of fast-growing early-stage startups.

Your focus will be on building and maintaining our delivery management system, which requires secure, resilient, and real-time ingestion, consumption and processing of data from various sources and integrations. Frontend, backend, working directly with our vehicle routing algorithms and ML-based optimisation engine - you’ll get to touch it all.

Palmo,,Bucharest,Founding Full Stack Engineer,"Join us on our journey to radically improve the way billions of parcels move through our cities.

The best way to get us there is city logistics. Electric vehicles, particularly light ones, are used in combination with urban hubs or brick-and-mortar stores to reduce CO2 emissions by 95%, lighten the traffic and pollution burden on our cities, and cut vehicle costs by half.
At Palmo, we are building the software layer for city logistics—a marketplace that will enable shippers (e.g. e-commerce retailers or national carriers) to connect to a single API and get millions of their parcels moved seamlessly through major cities, do so sustainably, and at a fraction of today's cost.

️ The technical challenge is immense. Vast numbers of retailers, fleets, vehicles, and warehouses need to be connected. Additionally, we have to orchestrate the efficient and automatic movement of thousands of parcels in real-time, using purpose-built optimisation algorithms and machine learning.

Currently, we are building the core technology called PalmoDMS and onboarding initial partners.

We are a small team of experienced builders and have offices in Berlin and Bucharest, though we are also open to outstanding remote profiles.
Having raised our first round of funding from top VCs & angel investors, we are now looking to build a world-class engineering team.
If you care about our mission, are deeply passionate about your work, and want to shape a high-growth startup from day 1, we’d like to talk.

Tasks

We are looking for an exceptional and experienced Full Stack Engineer.
You'll report directly to the CTO and have ownership and responsibility over key areas of our product and technology. As one of our first colleagues, you will be crucial in shaping Palmo’s success and culture. We are looking for a generalist who is excited at the prospect of mastering new technologies to solve business problems and will enjoy the thrills of fast-growing early-stage startups.

Your focus will be on building and maintaining our delivery management system, which requires secure, resilient, and real-time ingestion, consumption and processing of data from various sources and integrations. Frontend, backend, working directly with our vehicle routing algorithms and ML-based optimisation engine - you’ll get to touch it all.

Introduction
Alstom in Romania has been present for over 20 years employing today around 1100 people. Alstom, registered major success in infrastructure, signaling and also services. The long term service agreement for the maintenance of the rolling stock of Metrorex is a major reference and shows the expertise of Alstom in this field. Alstom will continue to grow his business in Romania proposing further services for the local market and export, creating regional hub in Services and Signaling.
The Brasov Sighisoara Project is part of the program of rehabilitation of the line “Brasov-Sighisoara” that is part of the European Corridor IV. The purpose of the project is to increase the running speed from 120 km/h to 160 km/h. The increase of the running speed requires the implementation of “the signalling code with four indications on BLA distances” and of “the signalling system with multi-step speed (MSS) in stations”. The home signals and the departure signals in each station will be relocated, because of the railway track systematization works. The existing train speed control and automatic stopping system (INDUSI) will be maintained for the trains running at speeds up to 120km/h that are not equipped with on-board ETCS unit (OBU). At “green” and “Blinking green” indications, the 500 Hz and 1000/2000 Hz indicators will be passive. For the national and international trains running at speeds up to 160km/h, and equipped with on-board ETCS unit (OBU), the ETCS Level 2 system with GSM-R will be implemented.

Join us at GE Digital Grid Software to be part of the team leading the digital transformation of the energy market. As the world’s energy sector moves away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy sources, this transformation will be key to making power-generating assets more efficient and the electric grid more secure and resilient. Our Geospatial products will play a critical role, by supporting the design, modelling and maintenance of electric, gas and telecommunications networks.
You will be a part of our Asset Management Engineering team, an Agile organization with a flexible working environment, where we are constantly looking to evolve our products, and the processes and technologies we use. Our current focus is on leveraging our long history of building client-server solutions, supported by our well-established geospatial experience, to develop innovative products, driven through microservices architecture and delivered via the Cloud. We are seeking to hire people who are passionate about technology, enjoy solving challenging problems and value the positive impact their work makes to our customers. As we significantly grow our current team, your technical expertise will enable us to implement this transformation.
You will be the senior engineering leader for a small team focused on the technologies and capabilities that enable build and release pipelines to be successful. Your team will collaborate with a number of Product Engineering teams and through this you will be involved at every stage of product development, from setting up research projects through to problem solving production issues for customers.

Your team is responsible for the infrastructure, tools and processes that enables development teams to be productive and deliver on their commitments. You are responsible for making your team a success.
Collaborating with around ten product and project teams you will develop the strategy and roadmap required for your team to deliver on the business goals. You will inspire and develop your team as you lead them in breaking down your vision into a deliverable plan and executing on that plan in sprintly increments.
Be in no doubt, this is a technical role and you should expect people from within and beyond your team to seek you out for your knowledge and skills with tools like Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes and your ability to give clear guidance on how best to apply them to the challenge at hand.
Your experience deploying cloud solutions will be essential to influence teams on how our products should be developed, deployed and maintained. Challenges will range from cloud native development deploying to AWS/Azure through to modernizing established products to be deployed and managed through Kubernetes.
Your team is responsible for the frameworks and infrastructure that support everything the development teams do; when they fail they will look to you. You will be calm when those around you are not. You will have data, know your system and be able to quickly put into action a plan to recover and keep everyone informed.
You will never be quite satisfied with your achievements, always seeing something else that could be better and challenging the status quo, you will instil a culture of innovation and the DevOps team will be a hub of change for itself and the teams around it.
You will be a thought leader in your field and will want to get your message out and as such you will influence both the current practices and future direction across GE.
