During the application process please feel free to share which pronouns you use (she/her/hers, he/him/his, they/them/theirs). And please let us know if you need any reasonable adjustments for the application or the interview.
The challenge
At Audiense we process more than one thousand million social profiles. We enrich them by applying several classification and segmentation algorithms to help customers such as Twitter, Telefónica, DHL, and Puma to define their marketing campaigns, identify influencers and discover new market niches.

Our challenge is to optimise the intake, enriching and storage of that growing data asset and to bring the insights computing to be as close as possible to real time.

For that we have a pipeline that ingests data from an enriching system mainly written in Node.js. This system consumes from many third party APIs and applies algorithms to infer new characteristics. This pipeline is able to keep updating a data lake of more than 100 TB that is used to generate reports for our customers using Spark and Scala.

Most of the Data Engineering code base is written in Scala, Spark and Typescript. This codebase is used both for maintaining our data lake and consuming it.

Our current focus is migrating and refactoring all the legacy parts of the batch-oriented ETL pipeline that feeds our data lake to a more real-time, event-oriented architecture based on Kafka.

In order to tackle this challenge, we are looking for people that will feel comfortable with the wide range of skills involved, someone that will add their experience to ours and help us fill the gaps by joining our team.
