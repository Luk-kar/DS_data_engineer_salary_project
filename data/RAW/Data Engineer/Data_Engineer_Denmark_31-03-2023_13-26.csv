What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

Would you like to impact the daily lives of people in every corner of the world? Then keep reading.
What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

Would you like to impact the daily lives of people in every corner of the world? Then keep reading.
What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

Would you like to impact the daily lives of people in every corner of the world? Then keep reading.
What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

Would you like to impact the daily lives of people in every corner of the world? Then keep reading.
What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

Would you like to impact the daily lives of people in every corner of the world? Then keep reading.
What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

Would you like to impact the daily lives of people in every corner of the world? Then keep reading.
What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

Would you like to impact the daily lives of people in every corner of the world? Then keep reading.
What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

Would you like to impact the daily lives of people in every corner of the world? Then keep reading.
What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

Would you like to impact the daily lives of people in every corner of the world? Then keep reading.
What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

Would you like to impact the daily lives of people in every corner of the world? Then keep reading.
What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

Maersk,4.2,Copenhagen,Senior Frontend Software Engineer – Decarbonization,"Pick a point on a globe, and Maersk won’t be far away. With 90% of global trade carried by sea, there is a high chance that the shoes on your feet or the phone in your pocket travelled to you on a Maersk vessel. Would you like to impact the daily lives of people in every corner of the world? Then keep reading.
What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!

What We Do
Come join us to help utilize technology to tackle the world’s CO2 challenge!

You’ve probably heard of or have even worked with IoT devices before. But have you ever heard of IoT devices that are close to half a kilometer long, weigh in at 300,000 metric tonnes and float around in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Well, we are lucky enough to work with these floating mega devices! We are even more fortunate to be tackling one of the most pressing issues in the world today….global warming.
But how do you mix large IoT devices with global warming?

Glad you asked! Shipping contributes to 3% of global CO2 emissions, and Maersk, as the world’s leading shipping company, has a large responsibility to tackle this issue and drive the industry towards solutions. Each decision starts with data and knowing our vessels’ data (intimately ) is part of our mission.

As a member of the tech teams in StarConnect (as we call ourselves) you will contribute to tackling the carbon pollution issue by using technology. And help us monitor our fleet’s fuel and empower our seafarers to reduce our carbon emissions.

We’re progressing well on a journey to bring our 700 container vessels online by hooking up to countless sensors onboard. But this has proven to be quite the challenge! Hardware installations & upgrades, deploying our apps and dealing with limited connectivity on remote platforms are some of the daily challenges we face in Maersk Decarb. But nothing comes easy when you’re working with such grand ambitions!
We are looking for a Senior Frontend Software Engineer for our Technical Efficiency & Data Collection team.

The team is building products deployed to the full fleet of Maersk vessels sailing around the globe. The aim of the products is to collect, automate & validate performance data from the vessels. This data is then modelled and turned into user insights & advice for energy decisions on-board and in office.

The end goal of our products is to drive fuel savings & reduce emission, to support Maersk's ambitious carbon neutral targets.

Our team is diverse! We are representing 7 nationalities and a variety of professions and specialialities - all working towards a common goal of supporting our users to reduce fuel & helping make their life easier on-board!
