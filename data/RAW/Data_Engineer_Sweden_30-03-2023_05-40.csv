Our next generation data quality platform monitors and validates both data in motion and data at rest across organizations data pipelines. Validio’s mission is to eliminate bad data and enable organizations to be data-driven with confidence. From startups to multi-billion dollar unicorns, Validio is used by data leaders of all sizes. We believe that you shouldn’t have to be an AirBnB, Uber or Netflix in order to have advanced ML-based data quality technology in place. We also believe that modern data teams and data engineers get better ROI by spending their time on other business-critical tasks rather than building and maintaining their own data quality infrastructure.

Here you will work with a senior team of data and engineering professionals with backgrounds from renowned research institutions, leading startups, and established tech companies. Named as one of the hottest start-ups in Stockholm by publications such as Wired, we are gearing up for expansion, and now you can be part of our journey!

As the complexity grows for both us and our customers, we are looking to our Customer Success Lead to strategize and lead customers to solutions.

Ingrid,5.0,Stockholm,Customer Experience Engineer,"About this role

At Ingrid, we believe that Customer Success begins with incredible people. If you have strong technical background, experience in customer success, and looking to join a startup with global potential, then read on!

Ingrid is currently looking for a customer-focused, highly technical Customer Experience Engineer to join our growing Customer Success team! We are looking for someone who can fill the role of a technical person that helps our customers, but also understands the engineering side. Someone who helps customers get past any technical hurdles in the pre-sales and post-sales stages. Someone who acts as the bridge between Engineering and Ingrid's customers.

Our ideal Customer Experience Engineer will always put the customer first, seeking to understand what the customer needs to accomplish — whether it's solving a technical problem or filling a feature request. We are looking for creative, critical thinking individuals with a tenacious love for problem solving.

If you are looking for an opportunity to couple technical knowledge and customer success, this job is perfect for you. If you are thinking “I love to code, but I really want to be doing more than just that. I like people, and I want to help people"" then this job is definitely perfect for you!

Our Customer Success team is on a mission to become one of the best teams in SaaS and our team consists of Customer Experience Engineers and Customer Success Managers. We believe in empathy, in transparency, in building trust with our customers, and in establishing long-term relationships by focusing on our customers’ goals and needs. Ingrid’s wins are tied to our customer’s wins.

Ingrid is a highly technical platform, but we do not expect you to have full-time engineer work experience in the past. You should have some understanding of technical concepts, a little coding experience to feel comfortable in your communication with customers and we will teach you the rest you need to be successful at Ingrid.

You’ll be part of an agile autonomous team working on extending and refining our core systems. Our teams solve a wide array of complex problems, below are some examples.

Capacity management - We believe in quick, exact, and efficient delivery. To know when we can deliver a specific parcel, or how to maximize locker compartment utilization, we continuously adapt and gain knowledge about of the current parcel delivery capacity in our locker network and how it changes over time. We use machine learning to model consumer pick-up behavior and forecast future parcel volumes from merchants.

Driver route optimization - Driving is at the core of what we do. Well-planned routes are essential for driver happiness, consumer satisfaction, and our ability to offer sustainable deliveries.

Locker fleet management - Our lockers are equipped with a tailor-made computer, a 4G modem with an intuitive interface. With a large growing fleet of lockers in multiple countries, we solve problems such as performing safe and secure software roll-outs, inventory management, and detection of malfunctioning hardware.

Eppow,,Stockholm,Software Engineer,"At Eppow, we’re passionate about solving complex engineering problems which have actual societal value.

What does that mean? These past years the focus has been the patient journey which is great but one very vital aspect has been forgotten. What about the doctors and nurses?

You’ll be part of an agile autonomous team working on extending and refining our core systems. Our teams solve a wide array of complex problems, below are some examples.

Capacity management - We believe in quick, exact, and efficient delivery. To know when we can deliver a specific parcel, or how to maximize locker compartment utilization, we continuously adapt and gain knowledge about of the current parcel delivery capacity in our locker network and how it changes over time. We use machine learning to model consumer pick-up behavior and forecast future parcel volumes from merchants.

Driver route optimization - Driving is at the core of what we do. Well-planned routes are essential for driver happiness, consumer satisfaction, and our ability to offer sustainable deliveries.

Locker fleet management - Our lockers are equipped with a tailor-made computer, a 4G modem with an intuitive interface. With a large growing fleet of lockers in multiple countries, we solve problems such as performing safe and secure software roll-outs, inventory management, and detection of malfunctioning hardware.
