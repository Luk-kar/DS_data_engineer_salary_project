In a $31tn FMCG market, with over 1 million manufacturers, 20m distributors and wholesalers and over 500m independent retailers, less than 3% of the B2B trading is currently done online. Our mission is to grow global online commerce for the world's small businesses by removing the barriers to online trading.
Currently, due to antiquated and high-cost payment networks, over $19tn of trade payments are made offline, adding complexity and inconvenience to online trading. This has resulted in local retailers, who directly influence >80% of local consumer buying behaviours, often being the least technically equipped with data, pricing, or the latest inventory.
So we built an Open Commerce Platform that enables the sale and distribution of FMCG products to be made much simpler. Products should be in front of sellers fast, in real-time, through an immersive commerce experience, with trade buyers and sellers able to see live commerce opportunities and pricing. We have built a digital ecosystem that is specifically designed to unlock the full value of the distribution network, providing real-time visibility for order and inventory management.

Probely,5.0,Home office,Technical Support Engineer (Remote/Hybrid),"Probely, a tech startup in the Cybersecurity B2B SaaS space, is looking for a sharp, passionate, and highly motivated Technical Support Engineer to join our team. This is a full-time, permanent contract, and full-remote position. You must be, however, located in a timezone between UTC-5 and UTC+1. If you are located in Lisbon, this can be a hybrid position.

At its core, Probely is a service that finds vulnerabilities in Web Applications and APIs and provides guidance on fixing them in a developer-friendly approach. It follows an API-first development approach, providing all features through an API; this allows Probely to be integrated into Continuous Integration pipelines to automate security testing and integrate with virtually anything!

The company has clients across the globe, from Australia to the US, and recently closed a Series A investment round. This is an excellent opportunity if you’re looking for a challenge and you want to grow your career in a young and growing company. Our team is cohesive and informal. Each person has the autonomy to try different stuff. We make mistakes, we learn from them, and we try harder.

In this role, you'll be helping the customer achieve success on using Probely. A typical customer journey involves the customer adding targets (web applications or APIs) to test, running scans, working on the results to achieve the risk level that the business is willing to accept, fixing vulnerabilities, and re-testing them. They can also integrate Probely into their CI/CD pipelines and Issue tracker for a seamless process.

On your day-to-day, you’ll be checking if the coverage of the customer's scans was good, if the target was configured correctly (such as authentication, integrations, etc.), validating vulnerabilities, and talking to customers to help them fix any issues. You’ll also onboard, train and be the technical point of contact for Enterprise customers.

You should be pretty familiar with HTTP; the browser's Inspect mode; DOM; HTML, and a bit of JS. Knowledge about application security is not a requirement, but being interested in the subject will make your stay here much more fun.
